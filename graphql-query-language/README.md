## Description
GraphQL is gaining traction as one of the most popular ways of creating an API. Regardless of which GraphQL implementation you pick, you’ll use the QL in GraphQL, the query language, to query data, to change data with mutations, and to listen for data changes with subscriptions.

In this course, we will learn the GraphQL Query Language by sending an assortment of GraphQL operations to an existing API. We’ll start by learning how to write queries to obtain all the data needed for an app in one response. As the course progresses, we will use mutations to add and change data. To wrap up, we will investigate GraphQL Subscriptions and real time data. Upon completing this course, students will know how to communicate with a GraphQL API using the GraphQL Query Language. This course is language-agnostic and requires no previous experience with any programming language.
