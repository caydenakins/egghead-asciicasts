## Description
In this course, we will learn how to set up all the necessary infrastructure to build a Design System of reusable React components, with state of the art developer experience afforded by Typescript and Storybook.

A design system is a series of components that can be reused in different combinations. Design systems allow you to manage design at scale. Design Systems can be a significant productivity multiplier in any medium-to-large project or company because you can document your components as you develop them, ensure a consistent look and feel throughout all your screens, and have a seamless workflow between designers and developers.
