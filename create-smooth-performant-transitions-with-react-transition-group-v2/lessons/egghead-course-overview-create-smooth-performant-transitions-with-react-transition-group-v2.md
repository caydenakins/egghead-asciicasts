In this course, we are going to learn about the fantastic React Transition Group library.

React Transition Group allows us to transition components in and out of the DOM in a declarative, neat, and efficient way.

I've personally used React Transition Group in my work as a front end developer, and usage of the library has allowed me to improve the user interface of several projects simply by applying subtle transitions with React Transition Group.

In this course we're going to concentrate on the CSSTransition and TransitionGroup components of React Transition Group. I'm going to be using a menu component to show you how React Transition Group works, hopeful that you can apply the same approaches to your own user interfaces with your own CSS transitions.

We're going to be looking at practical examples like using transitions with CSS-in-JS, and transitioning pages alongside react-router.

I hope you enjoy experimenting with React Transition Group alongside me. Animation brings user interface to life!
