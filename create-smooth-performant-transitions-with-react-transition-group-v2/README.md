Asciicasts for [Rory Smith's](https://github.com/alanbuchanan/) course on [egghead.io](https://egghead.io).

There are 10 transcripts, one transcript for each video.

## Description
In this course, we are going to use the fantastic React Transition Group library to write seamless, performant, beautiful transitions of elements in and out of the DOM.

With React Transition Group, you have the power of transitioning React components in and out of the DOM, depending on the state they are tied to, with no weird hacks. Without React Transition Group, you may find yourself using a lot of `display: none` in your CSS, along with some pretty nasty `setTimeout` hacks. But with it, you will find you can write your transition elements with a neat, declarative API, and no hacks in sight.

With v1 in production for some time, an overhaul to the API has arrived and culminated in v2, which yields a new API that is a pleasure to use.

I look forward to showing you all the features of React Transition Group in depth so that you can turn features of your React app from dull and boring to slick and seamless.
