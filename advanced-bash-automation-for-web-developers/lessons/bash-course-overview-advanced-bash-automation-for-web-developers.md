[00:35] This course is a follow-up to my previous course, [Automate Daily Development Tasks With Bash](https://egghead.io/courses/automate-daily-development-tasks-with-bash). If you're looking for a beginner-oriented introduction, I suggest starting there. I hope you learn something from this course and that it sparks ideas on how to automate tasks in your daily life.
