## Description
Bash makes automation easy — a few lines of code can take care of repetitive tasks for you and your teammates. In this course, we’ll dive deep into the automation potential of bash. We’ll focus specifically on learning to leverage some common “hooks” that open up interesting automation possibilities: things like git hooks, adding functions and aliases in your bash_profile, and running scheduled jobs in launchd. For example, we’ll write a git hook that checks package.json for changes, and if there are changes, runs npm install for you, automatically. Along the way, you’ll also learn more advanced bash commands, like exec, syntax, such as redirecting stdout and stderr to the same destination, and timesaving tricks, like brace expansions.
