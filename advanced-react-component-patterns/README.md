Asciicasts for [Advanced React Component Patterns](https://egghead.io/courses/advanced-react-component-patterns) course on [egghead.io](https://egghead.io/).

There are 19 transcripts, one transcript for each video.

## Description
The goal of this course is to give you the knowledge of advanced patterns you can use to make React components that are more flexible, simpler, and more fun to build, use, and maintain. You'll start with a simple <Toggle /> component which you'll progressively refactor to each of the patterns so you can see the relative trade-offs of the patterns and how they can be used together to increase the usefulness of your component while at the same time simplifying things for everyone.

Having built and shipped components using each of these patterns, Kent will help you understand and weigh the trade-offs of each of them and you'll come to intuitively know where to apply each pattern in your own components. When you're finished with this course, hopefully you'll have a list of actionable things you can do to rework the components that you're building to make them more flexible, simpler, and more fun to build, use, and maintain.

Enjoy!
