Asciicasts for [Tim Kindberg's](http://www.timkindberg.com/) course on [egghead.io](https://egghead.io).

There are 15 transcripts, one transcript for each video.

## Description
In this course, you will learn to use many of the most powerful and convenient higher-order components within Recompose by coding several real-world examples. Using recompose looks very different from “vanilla” React; so you will also get comfortable with the look and feel of a “recomposed” component. The best part is no more need of class components! You’ll learn how to use Recompose to both modify components and also create your own higher-order components.
