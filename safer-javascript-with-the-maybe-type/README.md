# Safer JavaScript with the Maybe Type

![course image](https://d2eip9sf3oo6c2.cloudfront.net/series/square_covers/000/000/176/full/EGH_MaybeJS_Final.png)

Asciicasts for [Andrew Van Slaars](https://egghead.io/instructors/andrew-van-slaars) course on [egghead.io](https://egghead.io/courses/safer-javascript-with-the-maybe-type).

There are 12 transcripts for each of the 12 lessons in the course. 

## Description
JavaScriptâ€™s dynamic typing makes it incredibly flexible. That flexibility can lead to trouble though. When values have the potential to change types or to end up as `null` or `undefined`, that can lead to runtime errors in our code or bizarre bugs that take forever to track down because of type coercion. To battle this, we end up with code that is littered will conditionals for `null` or `undefined` values and type checks, making the core logic harder to read and refactor later.

The Maybe encapsulates the type checking and guards against missing values for us. With Maybe in our toolbelt, we can keep our functions free of all the guardrails, outsource that work to the Maybe and keep our business logic free of all the clutter.
