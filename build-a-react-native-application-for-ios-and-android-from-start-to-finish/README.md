## Description
If you already know React, then React Native is a great way to build mobile apps for iOS and Android, but there are several differences between web and mobile apps.

In this course, we’ll build a mobile app from start to release with React Native for both iOS and Android.  Prior React experience is required, but you don’t have to know anything about mobile development.

Throughout the course, we’ll be building a “Restaurant Review” app.  We’ll use all the standard mobile UI elements like text, images, form inputs, buttons, scroll views, and icons, and we’ll show several navigation techniques like push, modal, and tabs.  The app will make HTTP API calls to a server and will store data on the device with AsyncStorage.  Finally, we’ll specify a custom app icon and splash screen, deploy the app to a physical device, and prepare the app for release to the App Store, Play Store, or for Ad-hoc release.
