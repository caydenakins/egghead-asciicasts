## Description
Progressive Web Apps are just Web pages, but with superpowers. They load under uncertain network conditions, even offline. They’re fast and engaging, providing the best user experience. They can be installed on your smartphone if the browser supports it, feeling like a native app.

In this course I’m gonna show you how to take an existing Single Page App made in Vue.js and pragmatically convert it to a Progressive Web App by creating a web manifest, then it goes through caching static assets, external resources and streams using service workers, applying code-splitting and lazy loading, notifying new versions of the app or wether is online or offline, understanding the preload and precache directives, finishing up by showing how to audit a Progressive Web App.

## Library Version
[Vue.js](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/releases): 2.5.16
