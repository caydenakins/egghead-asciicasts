Here I am in an empty folder and I want to get Elm installed. Elm's binaries are available through npm. I can install them just by typing `$ npm install -g elm`. ####Terminal```bash$ npm intall -g elm```Then I wait for a while. There it is. Now I can type `elm`. It should be in my path.![Elm in Terminal](../images/elm-install-the-elm-platform-command-line-tools-elm-in-terminal.png)I can also type elm-reactor to start the dev server, or I can type elm-repl to start a Read-eval-print-loop. ![Elm-reactor, elm-repl](../images/elm-install-the-elm-platform-command-line-tools-elm-reactor-elm-repl.png)Inside of here I can test it out, `foo = 1`, looks good, `bar = 2`, and `foo + bar` equals 3. We have elm installed.```bashfoo = 11 : numberbar = 22 : numberfoo + bar3 : number```
