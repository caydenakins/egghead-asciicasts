There are 13 transcripts, one transcript for each video.

## Description
In this course, we will go through the concept of transducers and build them up from basic principles. We will go over the problems with regular composed transformations, and show how we end up with unnecessary data and intermediate collections. We go on to learn how we can use transducers for performance gains when operating on large data sets, as well as how theyâ€™re an excellent fit for processing other iterable data, like generators. Not just arrays.
