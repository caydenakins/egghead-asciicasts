## Description
Angular 2 Directives allow you to add custom behavior to elements and components. Rather than creating a hierarchy of components to try to "extend" behavior, Angular 2 Directives enable you to compose behaviors on to your components. This includes adding event listeners that hook into services, manipulating templates, and adding more configuration to basic elements. This course helps you understand the concepts around building our Angular 2 directives and provides examples from basic directives that inspect elements to advanced structural directives that completely re-write templates.

If Angular 2 is new and the syntax foreign, you will want to check out [Get Started with Angular 2](https://egghead.io/courses/angular-2-fundamentals) and [Building Angular 2 Components](https://egghead.io/courses/building-angular-2-components).
