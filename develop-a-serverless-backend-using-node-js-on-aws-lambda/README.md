Asciicasts for [Nik Graf](https://egghead.io/instructors/nik-graf)'s course, Develop a Serverless Backend using Node.js on AWS Lambda on [egghead.io](https://egghead.io//courses/develop-a-serverless-backend-using-node-js-on-aws-lambda)

## Description

The core of serverless architectures are auto-scaling systems and a pay-per-execution pricing. Two traits that allows developers to significantly reduce operational cost and complexity, by outsourcing infrastructure management to cloud providers and focus on building business logic.

In this course we walk through the basics on how to create a serverless API. We start off creating a simple HTTP endpoint. Then we build the first two endpoints of a REST API for a simple Todo Application backend storing the data in DynamoDB. After watching this course you will be ready to get started building you first serverless backend.
