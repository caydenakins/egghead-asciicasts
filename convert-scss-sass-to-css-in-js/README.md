Asciicasts for [Oleg Isonen](https://egghead.io/instructors/oleg-slobodskoi) course, Convert SCSS (Sass) to CSS-in-JS [egghead.io](https://egghead.io/courses/convert-scss-sass-to-css-in-js).

## Description

In this course you will learn how to express popular SCSS (Sass) language features using latest JavaScript features. We will convert simple examples from SCSS to CSS-in-JS. As a designer or (S)CSS developer, you should be able to follow without extensive JavaScript knowledge, understanding SCSS is required though. We will not be using any particular CSSinJS libraries. Instead, we will focus on a base knowledge you need later if you use any CSSinJS library.
