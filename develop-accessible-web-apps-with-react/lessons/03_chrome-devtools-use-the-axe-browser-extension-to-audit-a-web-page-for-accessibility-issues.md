Instructor: [00:00] In order to install the `axe` browser extension, you'll need to either look in the Chrome Web Store for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/axe-web-accessibility-tes/lhdoppojpmngadmnindnejefpokejbdd), or in the browser add-ons for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/axe-devtools/), depending on which browser you wish to use. You just install the extension in the browser of your choice.

[00:26] Now that I've installed the extension in Chrome, let's go ahead and use it. Here, I have a sample web application with some accessibility issues baked in. If I open Chrome DevTools, I now have a tab for `axe`. If I select that and click the Analyze button, it will list whatever accessibility issues it's found for the current page.

[00:53] If you select an issue, you can choose to highlight each of the elements that have been found with that issue. Within the issue description, you can learn more about what the issue is. It shows you the source of the issue for the selected element. It lists the severity level. Here's a link to learn more about this issue.

[01:15] Here once again, we've got the severity level. We've got the standard that has been violated for WCAG. We have a bunch of information on how to fix the problem and why it matters, and then finally, links to more resources about this issue.

[01:36] Using `axe` is a great way to learn more about how to solve a plethora of accessibility issues with your website.
