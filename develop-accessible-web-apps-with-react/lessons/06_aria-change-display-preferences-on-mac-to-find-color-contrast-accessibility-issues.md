Instructor: [00:00] Here's a sample web application I've got with some color contrast issues baked in. Now let's modify the macOS accessibility display preferences to see how it impacts the color contrast of the page.

[00:13] We'll go to our `System Preferences`, and then the `Accessibility` preferences. If we want to get back here faster in the future, you can check this box to show accessibility status in the menu bar. Now the icon is right up here and we can get back there quickly.

[00:33] We'll go to the `Display` settings.

There are a few different settings we can modify. We could `Invert colors`, `Use grayscale`, and we can modify the amount of contrast. We can also see what it looks like when we combine some of these settings.

[01:08] These three are the ones that will have the most impact to your web page. The rest of these settings are primarily for operating system level display. You can see how turning these on and off doesn't really change the way the web page is displayed.

[01:25] It's always a good practice to just make sure that with any combination of these settings, everything on your page is still clear and easy to read.
