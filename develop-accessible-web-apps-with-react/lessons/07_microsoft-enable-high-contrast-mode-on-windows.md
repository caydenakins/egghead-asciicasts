Erin Doyle: [00:00] Here we are in Windows 10, and we want to enable high contrast mode. The fastest way to do so is to go down to the search box and enter `high contrast mode`.

[00:12] Here are the high contrast settings. There are four themes to choose from. There's `High Contrast #1`, `High Contrast #2`, the Black theme, and the White theme.

We're going to go ahead and apply the White theme.

[00:34] One way we can add a shortcut to get back to these settings quickly is by right-clicking on the `High contrast` item in the Ease of Access menu and selecting `Pin to Start`.

Now, when we go to the Start menu, we can see the high contrast settings.

[00:57] Another way we can get back to these settings quickly is by creating a shortcut. You go to the desktop, select New > Shortcut.

[01:06] For the location we need to enter `ms-settings:easeofaccess-highcontrast`.

We'll give that a name of `High contrast Mode` Hit Finish.

Now I've got a shortcut.

When we double-click it, it brings us right back to the settings.
