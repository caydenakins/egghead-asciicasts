## Description
One of the major innovations in Angular version 6 are Angular Elements. They allow us to develop Angular components just as we’re accustomed to, using their powerful API and then to compile them into browser native Custom Elements. Custom Elements are a web standard for defining new HTML elements in a framework-agnostic way. They extend the HTML by allowing us to define a tag whose content is created and controlled by JavaScript code.

In this course, we’re going to take a look how we can leverage Angular Elements within our Angular apps to make them even more dynamic, a use case that’s commonly required in CMS like environments. But not only, we’ll also see how we can compile our Angular Elements into a standalone script file that can be included in any other web context and how we can pass data and register events on those Custom Elements.
