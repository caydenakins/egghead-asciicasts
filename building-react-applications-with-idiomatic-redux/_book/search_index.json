For example, if you don't like the error notation, it is fine to replace with traditional function declarations that existed since the beginning of JavaScript.However, if you enjoy declaring your action creators as arrow functions, you can make them even more concise. In this action creator, right after the arrow, we put the curly brace to indicate the beginning of a block. It starts with a curly brace, it ends with a curly brace. The block contains a number of statements inside.index.jslet nextTodoId = 0; \nexport const addTodo = (text) => {\n  return {\n    type: 'ADD_TODO',\n    id: (nextTodoId++).toString(),\n    text,\n  };\n};\nHowever, in this particular case, the only statement it contains is the return statement. In this case, it is permissible to just use the value that just returned as the body of the error function.I'm removing the return statement, and rather than use a block as the body of my arrow function, I use the object expression. It's important to wrap it in parenthesis, so that parser understands this as an expression rather than a block.index.jslet nextTodoId = 0; \nexport const addTodo = (text) => ({\n  type: 'ADD_TODO',\n  id: (nextTodoId++).toString(),\n  text,\n});\nNow I'm repeating the same steps for any other function that just returns an object. In this case, I'm removing the explicit return statement and I'm changing the body to be an object expression.index.jsexport const setVisibilityFilter = (filter) => ({\n  type: 'SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER',\n  filter,\n});\nI'd do the same with toggleTodo. I remove the return, I remove the block. Instead, I wrap it in parenthesis, so it's interpreted as an object expression.index.jsexport const toggleTodo = (id) => ({\n  type: 'TOGGLE_TODO',\n  id,\n});\nYou can use this part outside action creators too. For example, often mapStateToProps and mapDispatchToProps just return objects, so it can be handy to apply it here as well, and remove the explicit return statement in favor of an object expression that becomes the arrow function body.FilterLink.jsconst mapStateToProps = (state, ownProps) => ({\n  active: ownProps.filter === state.visibilityFilter, \n});\nTo make mapDispatchToProps even more compact, I'm replacing the arrow function with a concise method notation that is also a part of ES6, and is available when a function is defined inside an object.FilterLink.jsconst mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch, ownProps) => ({\n  onClick() {\n    dispatch(setVisibilityFilter(ownProps.filter));\n  },\n});\nLet's recap. If the arrow function only contains a single return statement, you can replace the body of the arrow function with just a value. If this value is an object, don't forget to wrap it in parenthesis so that the parser understands that this is an expression and not a block.Also, it can be nicer to use the concise method notation inside mapDispatchToProps, instead of arrow functions because it's harder."},"lessons/javascript-redux-supplying-the-initial-state.html":{"url":"lessons/javascript-redux-supplying-the-initial-state.html","title":"Supplying the Initial State","keywords":"","body":"When you create the Redux store, its initial state is determined by the root reducer. In our case, the root reducer is the result of calling combineReducers on todos and visibilityFilter.reducers/index.jsconst todoApp = combineReducers({\n  todos,\n  visibilityFilter,\n});\nSince reducers are autonomous, each of them specifies its own initial state as the default value of the state argument, so it's an empty array for the todos reducer, and it's a string saying SHOW_ALL for the visibilityFilter reducer.visibilityFilter.jsconst visibilityFilter = (state = 'SHOW_ALL' action)\nThe initial state of the combinedReducer is going to be an object containing an empty array under the todos key, and show all string under the visibilityFilter key.reducers/index.jsconst todoApp = combineReducers({\n  todos,\n  visibilityFilter,\n});\nThis is going to become the initial state of this store, so if we log the current state of the store right after it's graded, we're going to see this object in the console.index.jsconst store = createStore(todoApp);\nconsole.log(store.getState());\nHowever, sometimes we want to load some existing data into the app synchronously before it starts. For example, we might have persistent todos from the previous session, and we might want to load this slice of the state into the app right before it starts.index.jsconst persistedState = {\n  todos: [{\n    id: '0', \n    text: 'Welcome back!',\n    completed: false,\n  }],\n};\nRedux lets me pass the persistentState as the second argument to the createStore function, and it will override the value specified by the reducers. If I refresh, I can see that the todos array now has a single item that I specified.index.jsconst store = createStore(\n  todoApp,\n  persistedState\n);\nHowever, the visibilityFilter value is still there, and it's still the default value specified by the reducer because it is not in my persistentState object, so the reducer takes control.Let's recap and see why this happens. Whatever value we pass to createStore as a second argument is going to end up in the root reducer as the state argument instead of undefined.reducers/index.jsconst todoApp = combineReducers({\n  todos,\n  visibilityFilter,\n});\nThe combineReducers implementation just forwards the parts of the state to the relevant reducers by their names. This is why the part of the persistentState with the key todos is going to end up as the state object the first time the todos reducer is called instead of undefined.todos.jsconst todos = (state = [], action) => {\nSince the state is not undefined, the default argument syntax has no effect, so state stays an array with one item. When Redux initializes the store, it sends an action that won't match any of your custom action types.todos.jsswitch (action.type) {\n  case 'ADD_TODO':\n    return [\n      ...state,\n      todo(undefined, action),\n    ];\n    case 'TOGGLE_TODO':\n      return state.map(t =>\n        todo(t, action)\n      );\n    default:\n      return state;\n  }\n};\nYour reducer is going to fall through to the default  case and return the state that it received, and in this case, this state object is the array with one item that we supplied here.index.jsconst persistedState = {\n  todos: [{\n    id: '0', \n    text: 'Welcome back!',\n    completed: false,\n  }],\n};\nHowever, the visibilityFilter key is not present on the persistentState object, so the parent reducer sees undefined there, and it passes undefined as a state argument to the visibilityFilter reducer.visibilityFilter.jsconst visibilityFilter = (state = 'SHOW_ALL' action)\nSince the state it receives is undefined, it uses the default argument as specified with ES6 default argument syntax. Just like inside the todos reducer, the action type is not going to match any of the known action types, so it will fall through to the defaultcase and return state.But notice that in this case, the state was initialized to 'SHOW_ALL' because it was initially undefined, and so the ES6 default argument syntax kicked in. This explains why the combinedReducer returned the initial state containing both the todos that we supplied and the VisibilityFilter supplied by the reducer by default.You might get tempted to specify all the initial state tree of your app in a single place and pass it to createStore, but we don't recommend this. Co-locating the initial state with the reducer definition makes it easy to test and change, so you should always strive to do that.However, you can use the second argument to create store for hydrating persistent data into the store, because it was obtained from Redux itself, so it doesn't break encapsulation of reducers."},"lessons/javascript-redux-persisting-the-state-to-the-local-storage.html":{"url":"lessons/javascript-redux-persisting-the-state-to-the-local-storage.html","title":"Persisting the State to the Local Storage","keywords":"","body":"I want to persist the state of the application in the localStorage using browser localStorage API. I'm going to write a function called loadState  and a new model that I'm going to call localStorage as that is going to use the localStorage browser API.The loadState function is going to look into localStorage by key, retrieve a string, and try to parse it as JSON. It's important that we wrap this code into try/catch because calls to your localStorage.getItem can fail if the user privacy mode does not allow the use of localStorage.localStorage.jsexport const loadState = () => {\n  try {\n    const serializedState = localStorage.getItem('state');\n\n  }\n};\nIf the serializedState is null it means that the SKI does exist so I'll return undefined to let the reducers initialize the state instead. However if the serializedState string exists I'm going to use JSON.parse in order to turn it into the state object. Finally in case of any errors I'm going to play it safe and return undefined to let reducers initialize the application.localStorage.jsexport const loadState = () => {\n  try {\n    const serializedState = localStorage.getItem('state');\n    if (serializedState === null) {\n      return undefined;\n    }\n    return JSON.parse(serializedState);\n  } catch (err) {\n    return undefined;\n  }\n};\nNow that I have wrote the function to load the state, I might as well write a function that saves the state to localStorage. It's going to accept the state as an argument, and it's going to do the exact opposite thing.localStorage.jsexport const saveState = (state) => {};\nFirst it serializes it to string by using JSON.stringify. This will only work if the state is serializable, but this is the general recommendation in Redux. Your state should be serializable. Now that both JSON.stringify and localStorage.setItem can fail so it's important that we catch any errors to prevent the app from crashing.localStorage.jsexport const saveState = (state) => {\n  try {\n    const serializedState = JSON.stringify(state);\n    localStorage.setItem('state', serializedState);\n  } catch (err) {\n    // Ignore write errors.\n  }\n};\nI'm just going to ignore them, but I might as well log them somewhere. Now I am also importing the saveState function I just wrote in the index.js. I need to save the state any time the store state changes, so I'm using the store.subscribe method to add a listener that will be invoked on any state change, and I'm passing the current state of the store to my saveState function.index.jsstore.subscribe(() => {\n  saveState(store.getState());\n});\nLet's see if it worked. I'm adding a few todos. I'm toggling one of the todos, and then I'm refreshing. The state of the app is preserved across reloads, and in fact the visibilityFilter is also preserved, which is probably not what we want, because usually we want to persist just the data and not the UI state.To fix this rather than pass the whole state object I'll just pass an object with the todos field from the state object. This way if I start with a clean localStorage and I add a couple of todos, and then I toggle one of them and change the visibilityFilter, after refresh the todos are still there, but the visibilityFilter gets reset to all.index.jsstore.subscribe(() => {\n  saveState({\n    todos: store.getState().todos\n  });\n});\nWhen the store is created the todos are preserved from the persisted state, but the visibilityFilter is initialized by the reducer. However, the current code has a bug. If I add a new todo to the existing todos it's not going to appear, and React is going to log a warning saying that I encountered two children with the same key, zero.What this means is that in the TodoList component when we render the todos, we use the todo.id as a key. The todo.id is assigned in the addTodo action creator, and it uses a local variable called nextTodoId as a counter.TodoList.jsconst TodoList = ({ todos, onTodoClick }) => (\n  \n    {todos.map(todo =>\n       onTodoClick(todo.id)}\n      />\n    )}\n  \n);\nIt's supposed to be unique. However if the application runs the second time the nextTodoId is going to be initialized to zero again so the new todo which is added also has an ID of zero just like the very first todo.actions/index.jsexport const addTodo = (text) => ({\n  type: 'ADD_TODO', \n  id: (nextTodoID++).toString(),\n  text,\n});\nTo avoid problems like this I'm going to install an npm module called node-uuid. It is a very tiny module, and it exports a couple of functions. The function we're going to use is called v4, which is just a name of the standard.It generates a unique string ID every time, and we're going to use this ID instead of a counter. I'm replacing the counter declaration with an import of v4 from the node-uuid, and I'm calling v4 to generate a unique ID in my action creator.actions/index.jsimport { v4 } from 'node-uuid';\n\nexport const addTodo = (text) => ({\n  type: 'ADD_TODO',\n  id: v4(),\n  text,\n});\nNow let's run the app again with a clean localStorage. I'm adding a couple new todos, I'm toggling them, and these arrive refreshed in the app. I can change the visibilityFilter, but it doesn't get persisted, because we only want to persist the data.Finally I'm adding a new todo, and it gets added successfully. It also gets persisted so I can refresh, do something with it, refresh, and it's there again in the correct state.There is just one more thing left to do. We're currently call saveState inside the subscribe listener so it is called every time the storage state changes. However we would like to avoid calling it too often because it uses the expensive stringify operation.localStorage.jsexport const saveState = (state) => {\n  try {\n    const serializedState = JSON.stringify(state);\n    localStorage.setItem('state', serializedState);\n  } catch (err) {\n    // Ignore write errors.\n  }\n};\n\nTo solve this I'm going to use a library called lodash which includes a handy utility called throttle. Wrapping my call back in a throttle call insures that the inner function that I pass is not going to be called more often than the number of milliseconds I specify.index.jsstore.subscribe(throttle(() => {\n  saveState({\n    todos: store.getState().todos\n  });\n}, 1000));\n\nNow even if this store gets abated really fast we have a guarantee that we only write to the localStorage at most once a second. Now I'm adding the import for throttle from lodash and know that I imported directly from a file called throttle so that we don't end up with a whole lodash in our bundle just because of a single function.index.jsimport throttle from 'lodash/throttle';\nLet's recap how we added the localStorage persistence to the todos app. First we created the new module with loadState and saveState functions. loadState looks into the localStorage, and if there is a serialized string of our state it tries to parse it as JSON.localStorage.jsexport const loadState = () => {\n  try {\n    const serializedState = localStorage.getItem('state');\n    if (serializedState === null) {\n      return undefined;\n    }\n    return JSON.parse(serializedState);\n  } catch (err) {\n    return undefined;\n  }\n};\nIf something goes wrong we return it undefined so that the app doesn't crash. We use the return value of loadState as the second argument to createStore so that it overrides the initial state specified by the reducers.index.jsconst store = createStore(\n  todoApp,\n  persistedState\n);\nWe want to be notified of the changes to the store state so we subscribe to it. We wrap our subscriber in throttle function from lodash in order to insure that it doesn't get called more often than once a second.index.jsstore.subscribe(throttle(() => {\n  saveState({\n    todos: store.getState().todos\n  });\n}, 1000));\nWe only want to keep the todos and not the visibilityFilter, so we explicitly parse an object that contains just the todos from the current state. Inside saveState we're going to serialize the current state to string with JSON.stringify and try to setItem, but if something fails, we're just going to ignore this error so that the app doesn't crash.localStorage.jsexport const saveState = (state) => {\n  try {\n    const serializedState = JSON.stringify(state);\n    localStorage.setItem('state', serializedState);\n  } catch (err) {\n    // Ignore write errors.\n  }\n};\nFinally we change the ID generation for todos from a simple in memory counter to a function from node.uuid that generates a unique ID string every time.actions/index.jsimport { v4 } from 'node-uuid';\n\nexport const addTodo = (text) => ({\n  type: 'ADD_TODO',\n  id: v4(),\n  text,\n});\n"},"lessons/javascript-redux-refactoring-the-entry-point.html":{"url":"lessons/javascript-redux-refactoring-the-entry-point.html","title":"Refactoring the Entry Point","keywords":"","body":"I'm extracting the logic necessary to create the store, and to subscribe to it to persist the state into a separate file.I'm calling this file configureStore, and so I'm creating a function called configureStore that is going to contain this logic so that the app doesn't have to know exactly how the store is created and if we have any subscribe handlers on it. It can just use the return store in the index.js file.configureStore.jsconst configureStore = () => {\n  const persistedState = loadState();\n  const store = createStore(\n    todoApp,\n    persistedState\n  );\n\n  store.subscribe(throttle() => {\n    saveState({\n      todos: store.getState().todos,\n    });\n  }, 1000))\n\n  return store;\n};\nIt is useful to export configureStore rather than store itself, so that if you later write some tests, you can easily create as many store instances as you want.

It's important that we use at least React Router 3.0 for it to work well with Redux. withRouter, it takes a React component and returns a different React component that injects the router-related props, such as params, into your component.VisibleTodoList.jsimport { withRouter } from 'react-router';\nI want the params to be available inside mapStateToProps, so I need to wrap the connectresult so that the connected component gets the params as a prop.VisibleTodoList.jsconst VisibleTodoList = withRouter(connect(\n  mapStateToProps,\n  mapDispatchToProps\n)(TodoList));\nI can scroll up a little bit to the mapStateToProps definition and I can change it so that, rather than read filter directly from ownProps, it's going to read it from ownProps.params.VisibleTodoList.jsconst mapStateToProps = (state, ownProps) => ({\n  todos: getVisibleTodos(\n    state.todos,\n    ownProps.parms.filter\n  ),\n});\nFinally, I specify the fallback value, just like I used to do in the app component. To make it more compact, I'm reading the params right inside the argument definition thanks to ES6's destructuring syntax.VisibleTodoList.jsconst mapStateToProps = (state, { params }) => ({\n  todos: getVisibleTodos(state.todos, parms.filter || 'all'),\n});\nLet's recap how we made the router params available inside the connected components' mapStateToPropsfunction. We'll read the params from the ownPropsargument, which corresponds to the props passed from the parent component. The params props specifically is passed by the component generated by withRouter call. This is how they end up in props of our connected component.VisibleTodoList.jsconst mapStateToProps = (state, { params }) => ({\n  todos: getVisibleTodos(state.todos, parms.filter || 'all'),\n});\nwithRouter passes any props through itself, so we're going to see both params, and any props passed from the app in the ownProps argument. Finally, I import withRouter from the React Router package. It only works correctly with connect since React Router 3.0, so make sure you're on the recent version.VisibleTodoList.jsconst VisibleTodoList = withRouter(connect(\n  mapStateToProps,\n  mapDispatchToProps\n)(TodoList));\nVisibleTodoList.jsimport { connect } from 'react-redux';\nimport { withRouter } from 'react-router';\nThe params injected by withRouter are the same exact params that get injected by default into the route handler components. You can use both ways of getting to the params and even mix them, but withRouter is handy when you need to read the current params somewhere deep in the component tree."},"lessons/javascript-redux-using-mapdispatchtoprops-shorthand-notation.html":{"url":"lessons/javascript-redux-using-mapdispatchtoprops-shorthand-notation.html","title":"Using mapDispatchToProps() Shorthand Notation","keywords":"","body":"The mapDispatchToProps function let's us inject certain props into the React component that can dispatch actions. For example, the TodoList component calls itsonTodoClick` callback prop with the ID of the Todo.TodoList.jsconst TodoList =({ todos, onTodoClick }) => (\n  \n    {todos.map(todo =>\n       onTodoClick(todo.id)}\n      /> \n    )}\n  \n);\nInside mapDispatchToProps we specify that when onTodoClick is called with an ID, we want to dispatch the toggleTodo action with this ID. The toggleTodo action creator uses this ID to generate an action object that will be dispatched.VisibleTodoList.jsconst mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => ({\n  onTodoClick(id) {\n    dispatch(toggleTodo(id));\n  },\n});\nindex.jsexport const toggleTodo = (id) => ({\n  type: 'TOGGLE_TODO',\n  id,\n});\nWhen the arguments for the callback prop match the arguments to the action creator exactly, there is a shorter way to specify mapDispatchToProps.Rather than pass a function, we can pass a special object, a map, in between the names of the callback props that we want to inject and the action creator functions that create the corresponding actions.VisibleTodoList.jsconst VisibleTodoList = withRouter(connect(\n  mapStateToProps,\n  { onTodoClick: toggleTodo }\n)(TodoList));\nThis is a rather common case, so often you don't need to write mapDispatchToProps, and you can pass this map in object instead.Let's recap.

In this case, rather than write mapDispatchToProps function yourself, it can pass a configuration object that maps the names of the callback props to the corresponding action creator functions.VisibleTodoList.jsconst VisibleTodoList = withRouter(connect(\n  mapStateToProps,\n  { onTodoClick: toggleTodo }\n)(TodoList));\n"},"lessons/javascript-redux-colocating-selectors-with-reducers.html":{"url":"lessons/javascript-redux-colocating-selectors-with-reducers.html","title":"Colocating Selectors with Reducers","keywords":"","body":"My mapStateToProps function uses the getVisibleTodos function, and it passes the slice of the state corresponding to the todos. However, if I ever change the state structure, I'll have to remember to update this whole side.VisibleTodoListconst mapStateToProps = (state, { params }) => ({\n  todos: getVisibleTodos(state.todos, params.filter || 'all')\n});\nAlternatively, I can move the getVisibleTodos function out of my view layer and place it in the file that knows best about the state.todos internal structure.The file that determines the internal structure of todos is the file that contains the todos reducer. This is why I'm placing my getVisibleTodos implementation right into the file with reducers, and I'm making it a named export.todos.jsexport const getVisibleTodos = (todos, filter) => {\n  switch (filter) {\n    case 'all';\n      return todos;\n    case 'completed';\n      return todos.filter(t => t.completed);\n    case 'active':\n      return todos.filter(t => !t.completed);\n    default:\n      throw new Error('Unknown filter: ${filter}.`);\n  }\n};\nThe convention I follow is simple. The default export is always the reducer function, but any named export starting with get is a function that prepares the data to be displayed by the UI. We usually call these functions selectors because they select something from the current state.In the reducers, the state argument corresponds to the state of this particular reducer. I'll follow the same convention in selectors, where the state argument will correspond to the state of the exported reducer in this file.todos.jsexport const getVisibleTodos = (state, filter) => {\n  switch (filter) {\n    case 'all';\n      return state;\n    case 'completed';\n      return state.filter(t => t.completed);\n    case 'active':\n      return state.filter(t => !t.completed);\n    default:\n      throw new Error('Unknown filter: ${filter}.`);\n  }\n};\nGoing back to my component, I still depend on the state structure because I read the todos from the state. The actual method of reading todos may change in the future.VisibleTodoListconst mapStateToProps = (state, { params }) => ({\n  todos: getVisibleTodos(state.todos, params.filter || 'all')\n});\nI am opening the file that contains the root reducer, and I add a named selector export there, as well. It is also called getVisibleTodos, and it also accepts the state and the filter, but the state corresponds to the state of the combined reducer.index.jsexport const getVisibleTodos = (state, filter) =>\nNow I want to call the getVisibleTodos function defined in the todos file alongside the reducer, but I can't use a named import because I have function with exactly the same name in the scope.This is why I'm using the namespace import syntax that puts all the exports on an object, called fromTodos in this case, so I can use fromTodos.getVisibleTodos to call this function I defined in the other file, and pass the slice of the state corresponding to the todos.index.jsexport const getVisibleTodos = (state, filter) =>\n  fromTodos.getVisibleTodos(state.todos, filter);\nNow I can go back to my component, and I can import getVisibleTodos from the root reducer file. It encapsulates all the knowledge about the application state shape, so I can just pass it the whole state of my application, and it will figure out how to select the visible todos according to the logic described in selectors.VisibleTodoListconst mapStateToProps = (state, { params }) => ({\n  todos: getVisibleTodos(state.todos, params.filter || 'all')\n});\nLet's recap how I co-locate the selectors with the reducers. Inside mapStateToProps, I call getVisibleTodos, and I pass it the whole application state.The fresh value of the state will be passed anytime it changes to the mapStateToProps function. I import getVisibleTodos selector, and notice the curly brace. This is a named import from the file that defines the root reducer.VisibleTodoListimport { getVisibleTodos } from '../reducers';\nIn the reducer files, I started adding new methods with get prefix that are exported as named exports, as opposed to the reducer, which is exported as a default export. It's easy to tell a named export because it doesn't use the default keyword after the export keyword.index.jsexport const getVisibleTodos = (state, filter) =>\n  fromTodos.getVisibleTodos(state.todos, filter);\nI want to limit the knowledge about the exact state shape to the files contained in the reducers that manage this state. todos is one of the reducers from which the root reducer is combined, so we know that its state is available as a state.todos under the todos key.However, the state shape of the todos reducer should be encapsulated in the file where it's defined. This is why I'm delegating the further selection to the getVisibleTodos I get from the from todos object that I import as a namespace import from the todos file, so I get all the named exports from it.index.jsimport todos, * as fromTodos from './todos';\nIn the todos file, I define my reducer as the default export. But I also define the getVisibleTodos implementation as a named export, and this time, the state refers to the state of just the corresponding reducer, which in this case is an array of todos.todos.jsexport const getVisibleTodos = (state, filter) => {\n  switch (filter) {\n    case 'all':\n      return state;\n    case 'completed':\n      return state.filter(t => t.completed);\n    case 'active':\n      return state.filter(t => !t.completed);\n    default:\n      throw new Error(`Unknown filter: ${filter}.`);\n  }\n};\ntodos.jsconst todos = (state = [], action) => {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case 'ADD_TODO':\n      return [\n        ...state,\n        todo(undefined, action),\n      ];\n    case 'TOGGLE_TODO':\n      return state.map(t =>\n        todo(t, action)\n      );\n    default:\n      return state;\n  }\n};\nIf I later want to change it to be something other than an array, I can change the getVisibleTodos implementation. But I won't have to touch my components, because they don't rely on the state shape anymore."},"lessons/javascript-redux-normalizing-the-state-shape.html":{"url":"lessons/javascript-redux-normalizing-the-state-shape.html","title":"Normalizing the State Shape","keywords":"","body":"We currently represent the todos in the state tree as an array of todo objects. However, in the real app, we probably have more than a single array and then todos with the same IDs in different arrays might get out of sync.This is why I wanted to treat my state as a database, and I'm going to keep my todos in an object indexed by the IDs of the todos. I've renamed the reducer to byId and rather than add a new item at the end or map over every item, now it's going to change the value in the lookup table.Both TOGGLE_TODO and ADD_TODO object is now going to be the same. I want to return a new lookup table where the value unto the ID in the action is going to be the result of calling the reducer on the previous value under reducer ID and the action.todos.jsconst byId = (state = {}, action) => {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case 'ADD_TODO':\n    case 'TOGGLE_TODO':\n      return {\n        ...state,\n        [action.id]: todo(state[action.id], action),\n    };\n    default:\n      return state;\n  }\n};\nThis is to reduce a composition but with an object instead of an array. I'm also using the object spread operator here. It is not a part of ES6 so you need to enable transform-object-rest-spread in babel reducer file, and you need to install the babel-plugin-transform-object-rest-spread for this to work..babelrc{\n  \"presets\": [\"es2015\", \"react\"],\n  \"plugins\": [\"transform-object-rest-operator\"]\n}\nAnytime the byId reducer receives an action, it's going to return the copy of its mapping between the IDs and the actual todos with updated todo for the current action. I will let another reducer that keeps track of all the added IDs.We keep the todos themselves in the byId map now, so the state of this reducer is an array of IDs rather than array of todos. I switch on the action type and the only action I care about is ADD_TODO because if a new todo is added, I want to return a new array of IDs with that ID as the last item.todos.jsconst allIds = (state = [], action) => {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case 'ADD_TODO':\n      return [...state, action.id];\n  }\n};\nFor any other actions, I just need to return the current state, that is, the current array of IDs. Finally, I still need to export the single reducer from the todos file, so I'm going to use combinedReducers again to combine the byId and the allIds reducers.todos.jsconst allIds = (state = [], action) => {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case 'ADD_TODO':\n      return [...state, action.id];\n    default: \n      return state;\n  }\n};\n\nconst todos = combineReducers({\n  byId,\n  allIds,\n});\nYou can use combinedReducers as many times as you like. You don't have to only use it on the top-level reducer. In fact, it's very common that as your app grows, you'll use combine reducers in several places.todos.jsimport { combineReducers } from 'redux';\nNow that we have changed the state shape in reducers, we also need to update the selectors that rely on it. The state object then getVisibleTodos is now going to contain byId and allIds fields, because it corresponds to the C of the combined reducer.Since I don't have the array of todos anymore, I will write the selector that is going to calculate it for me. I won't export it because I only plan to use it in the current file and it takes the current state and returns all the todos by mapping AllIDs to the state ByID lookup table.todos.jsconst getAllTodos = (state) => \n  state.allIds.map(id => state.byId[id]);\nI will use this name selector inside my getVisibleTodos selector to obtain an array of todos that I can filter. allTodos is an array of todos just like the components I expect so I can return it from the selector and not worry about change in my component code.todos.jsexport const getVisibleTodos = (state, filter) => {\n  const allTodos = getAllTodos(state);\n  switch (filter) {\n    case 'all':\n      return allTodos;\n    case 'completed':\n      return allTodos.filter(t => t.completed);\n    case 'active':\n      return allTodos.filter(t => !t.completed);\n    default:\n      throw new Error(`Unknown filter: ${filter}.`);\n  }\n};\nMy todos file has grown quite a bit so it's a good time to extract the todo reducer that manages just a single todo into a separate file of its own. I created a file called todo in the same folder and I will paste my implementation right there so that I can import it from the todos file.todos.jsimport todo from './todo';\nLet's recap how we change those state structures to be normalized and more like a database. I just extracted the todo reducer into a separate file but it hasn't changed in the state./reducers/todo.jsconst todo = (state, action) => {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case 'ADD_TODO':\n      return {\n        id: action.id,\n        text: action.text,\n        completed: false,\n      };\n    case 'TOGGLE_TODO':\n      if (state.id !== action.id) {\n        return state;\n      }\n      return {\n        ...state,\n        completed: !state.completed,\n      };\n    default:\n      return state;\n  }\n};\n\nexport default todo;\nIt's still a reducer that handles updates to a single todo item. I'm using this reducer inside the new reducer I wrote today, which is called byId and its state shape is an object. It reads the ID of the todo to update from the action and it calls the todo reducer with the previous state of this ID and the action.todos.jsconst byId = (state = {}, action) => {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case 'ADD_TODO':\n    case 'TOGGLE_TODO':\n      return {\n        ...state,\n        [action.id]: todo(state[action.id], action),\n    };\n    default:\n      return state;\n  }\n};\nFor the ADD_TODO action, the corresponding todo will not exist in the lookup table yet. We're calling the todo reducer with undefined as the first argument. The todo reducer would then return a new todo object when handling ADD_TODO so this object will get assigned under the action.id key inside the next version of the lookup table.Notice how we're mixing the objects spread operator with the computed property syntax, which lets us specify a value at a dynamic key inside action.id. Also, remember that the objects spread operator is experimental and you need a special babel plugin to enable it.I also wrote a second reducer called addIds that manages just the array of IDs of the todos. Every time a todo is added, it returns a new array with this ID of the new todo at the very end.todos.jsconst allIds = (state = [], action) => {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case 'ADD_TODO':\n      return [...state, action.id];\n    default: \n      return state;\n  }\n};\nIt uses the array-spread operator, which is part of ES6, to produce a new array with the allIds followed by the new ID. The two reducers now handle the same action. This is fine and very common in the Redux apps.I'm combining the two reducers I wrote into a single reducer by calling combineReducers provided by Redux. You may use combineReducers at multiple levels in your reducer hierarchy.todos.jsconst todos = combineReducers({\n  byId,\n  allIds,\n});\n\nSince the state shape changed, I needed to update the selectors that depend on it. I wrote the private selector called `getAllTodos` that just assembles all the todos objects from the state by mapping the IDs to the lookup table.\n\n**todos.js**\n```javascript\nconst getAllTodos = (state) => \n  state.allIds.map(id => state.byId[id]);\nFor every ID, we get the todo from state.byId. I'm returning the array of todos with exactly the same shape as the state inside getVisibleTodos used to be before this change.todos.jsexport const getVisibleTodos = (state, filter) => {\n  const allTodos = getAllTodos(state);\n  switch (filter) {\n    case 'all':\n      return allTodos;\n    case 'completed':\n      return allTodos.filter(t => t.completed);\n    case 'active':\n      return allTodos.filter(t => !t.completed);\n    default:\n      throw new Error(`Unknown filter: ${filter}.`);\n  }\n};\nI can get allTodos and now I can use allTodos for filtering and I can return it to the new ID that doesn't need to be changed, because all the state shape knowledge is encapsulated in the selector."},"lessons/javascript-redux-wrapping-dispatch-to-log-actions.html":{"url":"lessons/javascript-redux-wrapping-dispatch-to-log-actions.html","title":"Wrapping dispatch() to Log Actions","keywords":"","body":"Now that my state shape is more complex, I want to override the store.dispatch function to add some console logs there so that I can see how the state is affected by the actions.configureStoreconst configureStore = () => {\n  const persistedState = loadState();\n  const store = createStore(todoApp, persistedState);\n\n  store.dispatch = addLoggingToDispatch(store);\n\n  store.subscribe(throttle(() => { ... }\nI'm creating the new function called addLoggingToDispatch, that accepts store as an argument.

I'm painting the previous state gray. The action is blue, and the next state is green.configureStore.jsconst addLoggingToDispatch = (store) => {\n  const rawDispatch = store.dispatch;\n  return (action) => {\n    console.group(action.type);\n    console.log('%c prev state', 'color: gray', store.getState());\n    console.log('%c action', 'color: blue', action); \n    const returnValue = rawDispatch(action);\n    console.log('%c next state', 'color: green', store.getState());\n    console.groupEnd(action.type);\n    return returnValue;\n  };\n};\nA few final touches.

Now, every time I dispatch an action such as ADD_TODO, I can see it in the log. In the previous state, I can see that there are no IDs, and the byId look-up table is empty.Then I see the action with the type ADD_TODO, and the ID and text of the todo. Finally, in the state after dispatching the action, I can see both the ID in all IDs and the corresponding todo in the byId mapping.The only way to change the Redux store state is by dispatching an action, and now we log every action along with the state before and after it, so it's really easy to find, if there is a mistake in the state, which action caused it.Let's recap how this works. I added a new function that takes the store, grabs dispatch from it, and if your browser doesn't support the console group API, it'll just return the original dispatch function.configureStore.jsconst addLoggingToDispatch = (store) => {\n  const rawDispatch = store.dispatch;\n  if (!console.group) {\n    return rawDispatch;\n  }\n\n  return (action) => {...}\n\nOtherwise, I will return a new function that looks like dispatch. It accepts the action argument, and it even calls the original dispatch function inside. However, it also places a few logs into a group with the action type.configureStore.jsconst addLoggingToDispatch = (store) => {\n  const rawDispatch = store.dispatch;\n  return (action) => {\n    console.group(action.type);\n    console.log('%c prev state', 'color: gray', store.getState());\n    console.log('%c action', 'color: blue', action); \n    const returnValue = rawDispatch(action);\n    console.log('%c next state', 'color: green', store.getState());\n    console.groupEnd(action.type);\n    return returnValue;\n  };\n};\nI log the previous state by calling store get state before dispatching. I also log the action that caused the change, and finally, because I know that the store dispatch function is synchronous, I can call store.getState() again right after it to log the next state of the store.Finally, to keep complete compatibility with the underlying dispatch function, I return whatever it returned. Usually, this is the action object.My function returns a wrapped dispatch function, so I will use it to return value to override the store.dispatch method. I don't want to run this code in production, so wrap it in an environment check.configureStore.jsconst configureStore = () => {\n  const persistedState = loadState();\n  const store = createStore(todoApp, persistedState);\n\n  if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {\n    store.dispatch = addLoggingToDispatch(store);\n  }\n\n  store.subscribe(throttle(() => {...}\n\nThis check by itself is not enough, and it will only work correctly if in the production build you use Define plugin for Webpack or [inaudible 4:29] transform for Browserify."},"lessons/javascript-redux-adding-a-fake-backend-to-the-project.html":{"url":"lessons/javascript-redux-adding-a-fake-backend-to-the-project.html","title":"Adding a Fake Backend to the Project","keywords":"","body":"In the next lessons, we won't be dealing with persistence anymore.
