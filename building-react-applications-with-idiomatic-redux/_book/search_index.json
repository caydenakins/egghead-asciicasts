action creators are just regular JavaScript functions, you can define them any way you like. For example, if you don't like the error notation, it is fine to replace with traditional function declarations that existed since the beginning of JavaScript.However, if you enjoy declaring your action creators as arrow functions, you can make them even more concise. In this action creator, right after the arrow, we put the curly brace to indicate the beginning of a block. It starts with a curly brace, it ends with a curly brace. The block contains a number of statements inside.let nextTodoId = 0; \nexport const addTodo = (text) => {\n  return {\n    type: 'ADD_TODO',\n    id: (nextTodoId++).toString(),\n    text,\n  };\n};\nHowever, in this particular case, the only statement it contains is the return statement. In this case, it is permissible to just use the value that just returned as the body of the error function.I'm removing the return statement, and rather than use a block as the body of my arrow function, I use the object expression. It's important to wrap it in parenthesis, so that parser understands this as an expression rather than a block.let nextTodoId = 0; \nexport const addTodo = (text) => ({\n  type: 'ADD_TODO',\n  id: (nextTodoId++).toString(),\n  text,\n});\nI'm repeating the same steps for any other function that just returns an object. In this case, I'm removing the explicit return statement and I'm changing the body to be an object expression.export const setVisibilityFilter = (filter) => ({\n  type: 'SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER',\n  filter,\n});\nI'd do the same with toggleTodo. I remove the return, I remove the block.Instead, I wrap it in parenthesis, so it's interpreted as an object expression.export const toggleTodo = (id) => ({\n  type: 'TOGGLE_TODO',\n  id,\n});\nYou can use this part outside action creators too. For example, often mapStateToProps and mapDispatchToProps just return objects, so it can be handy to apply it here as well, and remove the explicit return statement in favor of an object expression that becomes the arrow function body.const mapStateToProps = (state, ownProps) => ({\n  active: ownProps.filter === state.visibilityFilter, \n});\nTo make mapDispatchToProps even more compact, I'm replacing the arrow function with a concise method notation that is also a part of ES6, and is available when a function is defined inside an object.const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch, ownProps) => ({\n  onClick() {\n    dispatch(setVisibilityFilter(ownProps.filter));\n  },\n});\nLet's recap. If the arrow function only contains a single return statement, you can replace the body of the arrow function with just a value. If this value is an object, don't forget to wrap it in parenthesis so that the parser understands that this is an expression and not a block.Also, it can be nicer to use the concise method notation inside mapDispatchToProps, instead of arrow functions because it's harder."},"lessons/javascript-redux-supplying-the-initial-state.html":{"url":"lessons/javascript-redux-supplying-the-initial-state.html","title":"javascript-redux-supplying-the-initial-state","keywords":"","body":"When you create the Redux store, its initial state is determined by the root reducer. In our case, the root reducer is the result of calling combined reducers on todos and visibility filter.const todoApp = combineReducers({\n  todos,\n  visibilityFilter,\n});\nSince reducers are autonomous, each of them specifies its own initial state as the default value of the state argument, so it's an empty array for the todos reducer, and it's a string to ensure all for the visibility filter reducer.const visibilityFilter = (state = 'SHOW_ALL' action)\nThe initial state of the combined reducer is going to be an object containing an empty array under the todos key, and show all string under the visibility filter key.const todoApp = combineReducers({\n  todos,\n  visibilityFilter,\n});\nThis is going to become the initial state of this store, so if we log the current state of the store right after it's graded, we're going to see this object in the console.const store = createStore(todoApp);\nconsole.log(store.getState());\nHowever, sometimes we want to load some existing data into the app synchronously before it starts. For example, we might have persistent todos from the previous session, and we might want to load this slice of the state into the app right before it starts.const persistedState = {\n  todos: [{\n    id: '0', \n    text: 'Welcome back!',\n    completed: false,\n  }],\n};\nRedux lets me pass the persistentState as the second argument to the createStore function, and it will override the value specified by the reducers. If I refresh, I can see that the todos array now has a single item that I specified.const store = createStore(\n  todoApp,\n  persistedState\n);\nHowever, the visibility filter value is still there, and it's still the default value specified by the reducer because it is not in my persistentState object, so the reducer takes control.Let's recap and see why this happens. Whatever value we pass to createStores as a second argument is going to end up in the root reducer as the state argument instead of undefined.const todoApp = combineReducers({\n  todos,\n  visibilityFilter,\n});\nThe combined reducer's implementation just forwards the parts of the state to the relevant reducers by their names. This is why the part of the persistentState with the key todos is going to end up as the state object the first time the todos reducer is called instead of undefined.const todos = (state = [], action) => {\nSince the state is not undefined, the default argument syntax has no effect, so state stays an array with one item. When Redux initializes the store, it sends an action that won't match any of your custom action types.switch (action.type) {\n  case 'ADD_TODO':\n    return [\n      ...state,\n      todo(undefined, action),\n    ];\n    case 'TOGGLE_TODO':\n      return state.map(t =>\n        todo(t, action)\n      );\n    default:\n      return state;\n  }\n};\nYour reducer is going to fall through to the default  case and return the state that it received, and in this case, this state object is the array with one item that we supplied here.const persistedState = {\n  todos: [{\n    id: '0', \n    text: 'Welcome back!',\n    completed: false,\n  }],\n};\nHowever, the visibility filter key is not present on the persistentState object, so the parent reducer sees undefined there, and it passes undefined as a state argument to the visibility filter reducer.const visibilityFilter = (state = 'SHOW_ALL' action)\nSince the state it receives is undefined, it uses the default argument as specified with ES6 default argument syntax. Just like inside the todos reducer, the action type is not going to match any of the known action types, so it will fall through to the defaultcase and return state.But notice that in this case, the state was initialized to 'SHOW_ALL' because it was initially undefined, and so the ES6 default argument syntax kicked in. This explains why the combined reducer returned the initial state containing both the todos that we supplied and the visibility filter supplied by the reducer by default.You might get tempted to specify all the initial state tree of your app in a single place and pass it to createStore, but we don't recommend this. Co-locating the initial state with the reducer definition makes it easy to test and change, so you should always strive to do that.However, you can use the second argument to create store for hydrating persistent data into the store, because it was obtained from Redux itself, so it doesn't break encapsulation of reducers."},"lessons/javascript-redux-persisting-the-state-to-the-local-storage.html":{"url":"lessons/javascript-redux-persisting-the-state-to-the-local-storage.html","title":"javascript-redux-persisting-the-state-to-the-local-storage","keywords":"","body":"I want to persist the state of the application in the localStorage using browser localStorage API. I'm going to write a function called loadState  and a new model that I'm going to call localStorage AS that is going to use the localStorage browser API.The loadState function is going to look into localStorage by key, retrieve a string, and try to parse it as JSON. It's important that we wrap this code into try/catch because calls to your localStorage.getItem can fail if the user privacy mode does not allow the use of localStorage.export const loadState = () => {\n  try {\n    const serializedState = localStorage.getItem('state');\n\n  }\n};\nIf the serializedState is null it means that the SKI does exist so I'll return undefined to let the reducers initialize the state instead. However if the serializedState string exists I'm going to use JSON.parse in order to turn it into the state object. Finally in case of any errors I'm going to play it safe and return undefined to let reducers initialize the application.export const loadState = () => {\n  try {\n    const serializedState = localStorage.getItem('state');\n    if (serializedState === null) {\n      return undefined;\n    }\n    return JSON.parse(serializedState);\n  } catch (err) {\n    return undefined;\n  }\n};\nNow that I have wrote the function to load the state, I might as well write a function that saves the state to localStorage. It's going to accept the state as an argument, and it's going to do the exact opposite thing.export const saveState = (state) => {};\nFirst it serializes it to string by using JSON.stringify. This will only work if the state is serializable, but this is the general recommendation in Redux. Your state should be serializable. Now that both JSON.stringify and localStorage.setItem can fail so it's important that we catch any errors to prevent the app from crashing.export const saveState = (state) => {\n  try {\n    const serializedState = JSON.stringify(state);\n    localStorage.setItem('state', serializedState);\n  } catch (err) {\n    // Ignore write errors.\n  }\n};\nI'm just going to ignore them, but I might as well log them somewhere. Now I am also importing the saveState function I just wrote in the index.js. I need to save the state any time the store state changes, so I'm using the store.subscribe method to add a listener that will be invoked on any state change, and I'm passing the current state of the store to my saveState function.store.subscribe(() => {\n  saveState(store.getState());\n});\nLet's see if it worked. I'm adding a few todos. I'm toggling one of the todos, and then I'm refreshing. The state of the app is preserved across reloads, and in fact the visibility filter is also preserved, which is probably not what we want, because usually we want to persist just the data and not the UI state.To fix this rather than pass the whole state object I'll just pass an object with the todos field from the state object. This way if I start with a clean localStorage and I add a couple of todos, and then I toggle one of them and change the visibility filter, after refresh the todos are still there, but the visibility filter gets reset to all.store.subscribe(() => {\n  saveState({\n    todos: store.getState().todos\n  });\n});\nWhen the store is created the todos are preserved from the persisted state, but the visibility filter is initialized by the reducer. However, the current code has a bug. If I add a new todo to the existing todos it's not going to appear, and React is going to log a warning saying that I encountered two children with the same key, zero.What this means is that in the TodoList component when we render the todos, we use the todo.id as a key. The todo.id is assigned in the addTodo action creator, and it uses a local variable called nextTodoId as a counter.const TodoList = ({ todos, onTodoClick }) => (\n  \n    {todos.map(todo =>\n       onTodoClick(todo.id)}\n      />\n    )}\n  \n);\nIt's supposed to be unique. However if the application runs the second time the next todo ID is going to be initialized to zero again so the new todo which is added also has an ID of zero just like the very first todo.export const addTodo = (text) => ({\n  type: 'ADD_TODO', \n  id: (nextTodoID++).toString(),\n  text,\n});\nTo avoid problems like this I'm going to install an npm module called node-uuid. It is a very tiny module, and it exports a couple of functions. The function we're going to use is called v4, which is just a name of the standard.It generates a unique string ID every time, and we're going to use this ID instead of a counter. I'm replacing the counter declaration with an import of v4 from the node-uuid, and I'm calling v4 to generate a unique ID in my action creator.import { v4 } from 'node-uuid';\n\nexport const addTodo = (text) => ({\n  type: 'ADD_TODO',\n  id: v4(),\n  text,\n});\nNow let's run the app again with a clean localStorage. I'm adding a couple new todos, I'm toggling them, and these arrive refreshed in the app. I can change the visibility filter, but it doesn't get persisted, because we only want to persist the data.Finally I'm adding a new todo, and it gets added successfully. It also gets persisted so I can refresh, do something with it, refresh, and it's there again in the correct state.There is just one more thing left to do. We're currently call saveState inside the subscribe listener so it is called every time the storage state changes. However we would like to avoid calling it too often because it uses the expansive stringify operation.\nexport const saveState = (state) => {\n  try {\n    const serializedState = JSON.stringify(state);\n    localStorage.setItem('state', serializedState);\n  } catch (err) {\n    // Ignore write errors.\n  }\n};\n\nTo solve this I'm going to use a library called lodash which includes a handy utility called throttle. Wrapping my call back in a throttle call insures that the inner function that I pass is not going to be called more often than the number of milliseconds I specify.\nstore.subscribe(throttle(() => {\n  saveState({\n    todos: store.getState().todos\n  });\n}, 1000));\n\nNow even if this store gets abated really fast we have a guarantee that we only write to the localStorage at most once a second. Now I'm adding the import for throttle from lodash and know that I imported directly from a file called throttle so that we don't end up with a whole lodash in our bundle just because of a single function.import throttle from 'lodash/throttle';\nLet's recap how we added the localStorage persistence to the todos app. First we created the new module with loadState and saveState functions. loadState looks into the localStorage, and if there is a serialized string of our state it tries to parse it as JSON.export const loadState = () => {\n  try {\n    const serializedState = localStorage.getItem('state');\n    if (serializedState === null) {\n      return undefined;\n    }\n    return JSON.parse(serializedState);\n  } catch (err) {\n    return undefined;\n  }\n};\nIf something goes wrong we return it undefined so that the app doesn't crash. We use the return value of loadState as the second argument to createStore so that it overrides the initial state specified by the reducers.const store = createStore(\n  todoApp,\n  persistedState\n);\nWe want to be notified of the changes to the store state so we subscribe to it. We wrap our subscriber in throttle function from lodash in order to insure that it doesn't get called more often than once a second.store.subscribe(throttle(() => {\n  saveState({\n    todos: store.getState().todos\n  });\n}, 1000));\nWe only want to keep the todos and not the visibility filter, so we explicitly parse an object that contains just the todos from the current state. Instead save state we're going to serialize the current state to string with JSON.stringify and try to setItem, but if something fails, we're just going to ignore this error so that the app doesn't crash.export const saveState = (state) => {\n  try {\n    const serializedState = JSON.stringify(state);\n    localStorage.setItem('state', serializedState);\n  } catch (err) {\n    // Ignore write errors.\n  }\n};\nFinally we change the ID generation for todos from a simple in memory counter to a function from node.uuid that generates a unique ID string every time.import { v4 } from 'node-uuid';\n\nexport const addTodo = (text) => ({\n  type: 'ADD_TODO',\n  id: v4(),\n  text,\n});\n"},"lessons/javascript-redux-refactoring-the-entry-point.html":{"url":"lessons/javascript-redux-refactoring-the-entry-point.html","title":"javascript-redux-refactoring-the-entry-point","keywords":"","body":"I'm extracting the logic necessary to create the store, and to subscribe to it to persist the state into a separate file.I'm calling this file configureStore, and so I'm creating a function called configureStore that is going to contain this logic so that the app doesn't have to know exactly how the store is created and if we have any subscribe handlers on it. It can just use the return store in the index.js file.const configureStore = () => {\n  const persistedState = loadState();\n  const store = createStore(\n    todoApp,\n    persistedState\n  );\n\n  store.subscribe(throttle() => {\n    saveState({\n      todos: store.getState().todos,\n    });\n  }, 1000))\n\n  return store;\n};\nIt is useful to export configureStore rather than store itself, so that if you later write some tests, you can easily create as many store instances as you want.

I moved all the code that is necessary for creating the store into a separate module. This module exports a function called configureStore. It takes care of creating the store with the right reducer and the right initial state, and setting up any kinds of subscriptions, so that it returns a store that is ready for consumption by my application.const configureStore = () => {\n  const persistedState = loadState();\n  const store = createStore(\n    todoApp,\n    persistedState\n  );\n\n  store.subscribe(throttle() => {\n    saveState({\n      todos: store.getState().todos,\n    });\n  }, 1000))\n\n  return store;\n};\nI also moved the Root component into a separate file.

However, in practice, what matters is that there's just one single source of truth for any independent piece of data.We're using Redux as the source of truth for the todos, and we're using React Router as the source of truth for anything that can be computed from the URL.

We'll read the params from the ownPropsargument, which corresponds to the props passed from the parent component. The params props specifically is passed by the component generated by withRouter call. This is how they end up in props of our connected component.\nVisibleTodoList.jsconst mapStateToProps = (state, { params }) => ({\n  todos: getVisibleTodos(state.todos, parms.filter || 'all'),\n});\nwithRouter passes any props through itself, so we're going to see both params, and any props passed from the app in the ownProps argument. Finally, I import withRouter from the React Router package. It only works correctly with connect since React Router 3.0, so make sure you're on the recent version.\nVisibleTodoList.jsconst VisibleTodoList = withRouter(connect(\n  mapStateToProps,\n  mapDispatchToProps\n)(TodoList));\n\nVisibleTodoList.jsimport { connect } from 'react-redux';\nimport { withRouter } from 'react-router';\nThe params injected by withRouter are the same exact params that get injected by default into the route handler components. You can use both ways of getting to the params and even mix them, but withRouter is handy when you need to read the current params somewhere deep in the component tree."},"lessons/javascript-redux-fetching-data-on-route-change.html":{"url":"lessons/javascript-redux-fetching-data-on-route-change.html","title":"javascript-redux-fetching-data-on-route-change","keywords":"","body":"I'm removing the fetch todos API call from my entry point because I want to fetch the todos inside my component. The component that displays and selects the todos is the visible todo list. I'm placing the fetch todos import into the visible todo list file.The visible todo list component is generated by the connect, and with router calls that each generate an intermediate component that inject props. A good place to call the API would be inside componented mount life cycle hook.Since I can't override the life cycle hooks of generated components, I have to create a new React component. I'm importing React and the component base class from React, and I will declare a React component class called visible todo list.It extends the React base component class. I'm defining the rend method, and I still want to render the presentational to the list component exactly. The only purpose of adding this new class is to add the life cycle hooks. I will pass any props down to the todo list.Since the visible todo list is defined as a class above, I can't declare another constant with the same name, but I can reassign the visible todo list binding to point to the wrapped component. Now I'm changing the connect call to wrap my new class instead.The component generated by the connect call will render the visible todo list class I defined. The result of the connect, and with router wrapping calls is the final todo list component that I export from the file.Now I will define the componented mount life cycle hook inside my visible todo list component class. When the component mounts, I want to fetch the todos for the current filter. It will be convenient to have the filter directly available as a prop.I am changing map state props to calculate the filter from params, just like it used to, but to also pass it as one of the properties on the return object. I will get both the todos and the filter itself inside the visible todo list component.Going back to the life cycle method, I can use this props filter inside componented mount now. When the todos are fetched, fetch todos returns a promise. I can use the then method to access the resolved todos, and to log the current filter, and the todos I just received from the fake backend.If I run the app now, I will see the all filter being printed, and the todos corresponding to the all filter. However, as I change the filter, nothing happens, because componented mount only runs once. To fix this, I am adding a second life cycle hook called componented update.It receives the previous props as an argument. I can compare the current and the previous values of the filter. If the current filter is not the same as the previous filter, it's time to fetch the todos for the current filter.I'm writing exactly the same code. When the todos are fetched, I want to print the current filter, and the corresponding todos. Clicking on a link now changes the route, and so it changes the filter prop. As a result, we fetch the data in the life cycle hooks."},"lessons/javascript-redux-wrapping-dispatch-to-recognize-promises.html":{"url":"lessons/javascript-redux-wrapping-dispatch-to-recognize-promises.html","title":"Redux wrapping recognizes promises","keywords":"","body":"The receive todo action creator is not very useful by itself because anytime we call it, we want to fetch the todos first. Also, they accept the same argument so it would be great if we could group this code into a single action creator.I'm opening the file where I define the action creators and I'm adding a new import there. It will make all functions in the API module available on the API namespace import object.I'm adding a special kind of action creator that I'm going to call in an asynchronous action creator. It takes filter as an argument and it calls the API fetch todos method with it. I'm using the promise the method to transform the result of the promise from the response to the action object generated by received todos given the filter and the response.Received todos return an action object synchronously but fetch todos returns a promise that resolves through the action object. I can stop exporting receive todos because I'll change the components to sue fetch todos directly.I'm going back to my component file and I can use the fetch todos prop injected by connect which corresponds to the new asynchronous fetch todos action creator. I'm removing the direct import of fetch todos function from API because from now on I'll be using the fetch todos action creator, which is injected into the props by connect.Let's take another look at what happens in the action creators. The fetch todos action creator calls the fetch todos function from the API but then it transforms its result into a Redux action generated by receive todos.However, by default, Redux only allows dispatch in plain objects rather than promises. We can teach it to recognize promises by using the same trick that we use for login every dispatch.A login into dispatch is the function we wrote before that creates the dispatch from the store and returns a new version of dispatch that logs every action and the state. In a similar fashion, I can create a function called at promise support the dispatch that takes the store and returns a version of dispatch that supports promises.First, we will write the raw dispatch function at it is defined on the store so that we can call it later. We return a function that has the same API as a dispatch function that is, it takes an action.We don't know if the action is a real action or a promise of action, which hack if it has a then method that is a function, which is a way to tell if something is a promise. If it is a promise, we wait for it to resolve to an action object that we pass through raw dispatch.Otherwise, we'll just call raw dispatch right away with the action object we received. Now, we can dispatch both actions and promises that resolve to actions. Finally, I need to use the function I just wrote to write the dispatch function one more time before returning the store to the app.If I run the app now, I will still see the receive todos action being dispatch when the response is ready. However, the component uses a more convenient API that encapsulates the asynchronous logic in the asynchronous action creator.One thing to remember is that the order in which we override the dispatch function is important. If we change it, the action will first be printed and then the promise will be processed so action type is undefined and we see the promise instead of the action, which is not very useful.This is why I'm changing the auto back so that the promises are resolved before the action is locked. Let's recap how we added the promise support to the dispatch function.We override store dispatch two times. Once to add the login and second time to add the promise support. The function that adds the promise support accepts the store an argument and it reaches the previous value of the dispatch function.It returns a function that looks like a dispatch function because it accepts the action but if the action is not really an action but a promise, we're going to wait for that promise to resolve to the real action, which will pass through raw dispatch.Finally, if the action is not a promise, we'll just dispatch it right away by calling raw dispatch. Let's see what happens when we try to dispatch the result of call and fetch todos asynchronous action creator.First of all, it calls the fetch todos function from the API module, which I import as a namespace import. It waits for the promise to resolve with the response and rather than return the response, it returns the result of calling receive todos action creator, which returns an action object.This is why fetch todos, itself, returns a promise that resolves through the action returned by receive todos. The wrap dispatch function recognizes that this is a promise and not an action so it waits for the promise to resolve and passes it on through the raw dispatch function with dispatches the action object returned by receive todos.I remove the export from receive todos because it is only used as part of the asynchronous fetch todos action creator. Being a named expert, it becomes available as part of the actions object, which is the namespace import invisible todo list.The actions object gets passed as a second argument through the connect function. This has me call these props fetch todos from my component without thinking whether it is backed by a synchronous and an asynchronous action creator."},"lessons/javascript-redux-the-middleware-chain.html":{"url":"lessons/javascript-redux-the-middleware-chain.html","title":"Redux MiddleWare Chain","keywords":"","body":"We have written two functions that wrap the dispatch function to add custom behavior. Let's take a closer look at how they work together.The final version of the dispatch function before we turn in the store is the result of calling add promise support to this patch.The function it returns acts like a normal dispatch function, but if it gets a promise, it waits for this promise to resolve and passes the result to raw dispatch, where raw dispatch is the previous value of store dispatch.For non-promises, it calls raw dispatch right away. Raw dispatch corresponds to the store dispatch at the time add promise support to dispatch was called.Store dispatch was reassigned earlier, so it's not completely fair to refer to it as raw dispatch. I'm renaming raw dispatch to next because this is the next dispatch function in the chain.It refers to store dispatch that was returned from add login to dispatch. Add login to dispatch also returns a function with the same API as the original dispatch function, but it logs the action type, the previous state, the action, and the next state along the way.It calls the raw dispatch with corresponds to store dispatch at the time add login to dispatch was called. In this case, this is the store dispatch provided by create store.However, it is entirely conceivable that we might want to override dispatch function before adding the login. For consistency, I'm going to rename raw dispatch to next, as well. It's just that in this particular case, next points to the original store dispatch.While this method of extending the store works, it's not really great at re-override the public API and replace it with custom functions. To get away from this pattern, I am declaring an array of what I'm calling middleware functions, which is just a fancy name I use for these functions I wrote, and I'm pushing add login to dispatch itself to an array, so this is an array of functions that will be applied later as a single step.I'm also adding add promise support to dispatch to the middleware array, and again, I don't need to apply it yet because I'll write a separate function that applies the middlewares.I will call this function grab dispatch with middlewares, and I'll pass this store as the first argument and an array of middlewares as the second argument.I'm adding this new function called grab dispatch with middlewares, and inside it I'm going to use the middlewares for each method. to run some code for every middleware.Specifically, I want to override this store dispatch function to point to the result of calling the middleware with the store as an argument.Inside the middleware functions themselves, there is a certain pattern that I have to repeat. I'm grabbing the value of store dispatch, and I'm storing it in a variable called next so that I can call it later.To make it a part of the middleware contract, I can make next an outside argument, just like the store before it and the action after it.This way, the middleware becomes a function that returns a function that returns a function, which is not very common in JavaScript, but is actually very common in functional programming languages, and this pattern is called Korean.Again, rather than take the next middleware from the store, I will make it intractable as an argument so that my function that calls the middlewares can choose which middleware to pass.Finally, store is not the only injected argument, so I also need to inject the next middleware, which is the previous value of store dispatch function.Now that middlewares are a first-class concept, I will rename add login to dispatch to just logger, and I will rename add promise support to dispatch to the promise middleware.The Korean style of function declaration can get very hard to read. However, we can use arrow functions and rely on the fact that arrow functions can have expressions as their bodies.It is still a function that returns a function returning a function, but it's much easier to read, and the mental model you can use for this is that this is just a function with several arguments that are applied as they become available.Finally, I'd like to fix the order in which middlewares are specified. They are currently specified in the order in which the dispatch function is overridden. However, it would be more natural to specify the order in which the action propagates through the middlewares.This is why I'm changing my middleware declaration to specify them in the order in which the action travels through them. Instead, I will grab dispatch with middlewares from right to left, so I clone the past array and I reverse it.Let's recap what we learned about middleware so far. Middleware can serve very different purposes. It might add some useful debugging information, such as the case with login middleware, or it might amend dispatch to understand something other than plain actions, which is the case with the promise middleware.We created a new function that takes the store and an array of middlewares, and does the dirty work of reassigning the store dispatch function. This lets me keep configure store a little bit more declarative, because I specified the middlewares in an array, and I call grab dispatch with middlewares to apply them.Let's recap how grab dispatch with middlewares works internally. The store object that the application uses contains a dispatch function. Grab dispatch with middlewares overrides it multiple times as it enumerates the middleware's array.However, it reverses the array before enumerating it, so the final value of store dispatch will correspond to the result of calling the first middleware in the array, which is the promise middleware.The promise middleware returns a dispatch function that understands promises, but to get it, we pass the store and the next dispatch function as carried arguments.The next dispatch function is the one that we got from the middleware that appeared earlier in the reverse array, or later in the original array, and this is the logger middleware.The logger middleware provided the dispatch function that logs the actions, but to get it, we passed the store and the next dispatch function to it, and it corresponded to the value store dispatch that was there before the middleware was even applied, and this is the original dispatch implementation from create store.The purpose of the middlewares is to replace the single dispatch function with a chain of composable dispatch functions which each can do something with an action.The promise middleware appears before the logger middleware in the chain, and this is why the next inside it corresponds to the dispatch function returned from the logger middleware.Logger middleware itself is the last middleware in chain, so its next function corresponds to the original store dispatch function, which is defined inside create store.Middleware is a powerful system that lets us put custom behavior before action reaches the reducers. People use middleware for different purposes, such as login, analytics, error-handling, asynchronous counterflow, and more."},"lessons/javascript-redux-dispatching-actions-with-the-fetched-data.html":{"url":"lessons/javascript-redux-dispatching-actions-with-the-fetched-data.html","title":"javascript-redux-dispatching-actions-with-the-fetched-data","keywords":"","body":"I can extract the common code between the lifecycle hooks into a separate method. I will call it \"fetchData.\" It will fetch the data for the current props.In this case, the data we want to fetch only depends on the filter. I'm calling this method from the componentDidMount hook, to fetch the initial data, and I also call it whenever the filter changes inside the component it update, lifecycle hook.We want the fetched routers to become a part of the Redux Store state. The only way to get something into the state is to dispatch an action. I'm going to call the callback prop called \"receive todos,\" whether to todos I just fetched.To make it available inside the component, I need to pass a function called receive todos hat would be an action creator inside the second argument to connect. Since the name of the function will match the name of the callback prop, I can use the shorter ES6 prop edition.I will import receive todos from the file where I define all other action creators. Now, I can open that file with the action creators and actually implement it.I'm creating a new export of function called receive todos that takes the server response as an argument and returns an object with the type of receive todos and the response as a field.The reduce is handling this action. We'll need to know which filter the response corresponds to so I'm adding a filter as an argument to the receive todos action creator and I'm passing it as part of the action object.I'm going back to my component so I can pass the filter through the action creator. I'm destruction the filter and receive todos from props using ES6 destruction syntax. It's important that I destruct the filter right away, because by the time the callback fires this props filter might have changed because they use it and might have navigated away.If around the app now, I will see Redux actions being dispatched, ready to be handled by the reducers. They include all the necessary information, such as the filter and the server response.As I navigate through the app, the component fetches data in lifecycle hooks and dispatches Redux actions when the data is ready. As a final touch, I like to write less plate code when importing action creators.I'm replacing name to imports with the namespace \"import\" so that any function exported from the actions file will be in the object called \"actions,\" which I will pass as a second argument to connect.I'm restructuring the props, because the toggle to the action creator needs to be passed under on todo click callback prompt name, but the rest of the props can be passed as the other.The rest object now continues all the props other than to toggle todo, so I will pass them through. I will also pass toggle todo as on todo click prop, because that's what todo list component expect.Finally, I'm splitting it over multiple lines for a little better readability. Let's recap how we fetch asynchronously in response to route changes. In the file where I define action creators, I add a new action creator called receive todos that accepts the filter and the response as arguments.It produces a regular Redux action object that can be dispatched after the request of the server has completed. I created a new react class component so that I can use lifecycles hooks, such as componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate to fetch the data.I'm fetching the data when the component mounts for the first time and if the filter prop, provided by react router changes, which means that user has navigated in the app. The visible todo list is the container component that enhances a presentational component called todo list when the data fetch an object.However, the class who wrote does not subscribe to the store itself so we wrap it in a connect call so that the containers generated by react Redux connect subscribes to the store and passes the props through the visible todo list component we wrote.Finally, the component generated by the router subscribes to the router changes so we have access to the router params in map state to props. The components we want to export are the result of colon disrupters so I reassign visible todo list and export it.Inside the map state of props, I read the filter value from the parameters supply direct order or use the default value. I used to only use filter for calculating the visible todos, but now, I also want to pass it as a prop so that it's available inside the component.Having access to the filter prop, let's determine whether I should fetch the data and pass it to the function that fetches todos. I import this function from the file where I define our fake API, which can be replaced by real API client.We fetch data when the component mounts and when the filter prop changes. Fetch lose return the promise so when it results, I use the response, to dispatch an action receive todos with the filter and the server response.The receive todos function available on the props dispatches the action returned by receive todos action creator automatically. This happens because I pass at this part of the actions object to connect.The actions object contains all the exported action creators defined in the actions.js file, because I use the ES6 namespace import syntax. The receive todos action creator does not automatically dispatch an action, but the receive todos prop injected by connect does.When I call it, it will call my action creator with the same arguments and dispatch the resultant action to the Redux Store. Inside the rented method, I rented to the presentational todo list component.Now that all action creators are injected as props with the same names, I have to grab toward todo specifically and pass it as onto click called by prop that todo list expects, but the rest props can be passed with their existing names."},"lessons/javascript-redux-applying-redux-middleware.html":{"url":"lessons/javascript-redux-applying-redux-middleware.html","title":"javascript-redux-applying-redux-middleware","keywords":"","body":"In the previous lesson, we figured out the contract that we want to use for our middleware functions. However, middleware wouldn't be very useful if everybody had to implement REV dispatch with middleware on their own. This is why I'm removing it, and instead I'm going to import a utility called apply middleware from Redux. I'm going back to my configure store function. I notice that I don't need the store right away. I can move the store creation after specifying the middleware.I can also remove my custom function, and instead I will create store with the middleware right away. I am passing the second argument to create store, which is the result of calling apply middleware with my middleware functions as positional arguments. This last argument to create store is called an enhancer, and it's optional. If you want to specify the persistent state, you need to do this before the enhancer. You can also keep the persistent state if you don't have.Many middlewares are available as NPM packages. Both the promise middleware and the logger middleware are no exceptions to this. I am opening up a terminal, and I'm running NPM install safe Redux promise, which is a middleware that implements the promise support.I can install a package called Redux Logger in the same way, which is similar to the logger middleware we wrote before, but it's more configurable. I am adding an input called lowercase promise that corresponds to the Redux promise middleware, and I'm inputting create logger from Redux Logger. It lets you configure the middleware before creating it. I won't pass any options to gather default configuration. Finally, since I don't need to reference the store anymore, I'll just return it directly from configure store.Let's recap how to apply Redux middleware. We use the function called apply middleware that we import from Redux. It accepts the middleware functions as positional arguments. For example, we could have written promise, create logger. However, we only want to apply the logger conditionally. If we're not running in the production environment, we will push the logger to the array of middlewares. We use the ES6 spread operator to pass every middleware as a positional argument to apply middleware.The apply middleware returns something called an enhancer. This is the optional last argument to create store. If you want to also supply the persistent state, you need to do this before the enhancer."},"lessons/javascript-redux-updating-the-state-with-the-fetched-data.html":{"url":"lessons/javascript-redux-updating-the-state-with-the-fetched-data.html","title":"javascript-redux-updating-the-state-with-the-fetched-data","keywords":"","body":"In the current implementation, we keep all these in memory at once. We have an array of all IDs ever and we get the array of to-dos that we can filter according to the filter passed from React router.However, this only works correctly if all the data from the server is already available in the client, which is usually not the case with applications that fetch something. If we have thousands of to dos on the server, it would be impractical to fetch them all and filter them on the client.Rather than keep on big list of IDs, we'll keep a list of IDs for every tab so that they can be stored separately and filled according with the actions with the fetch data on the corresponding tab.I'm removing the get alt to-do selector because we won't have access to all to dos. We also don't need to filter on the client anymore because we will use the list of to-dos provided by the server.Rather than read from state all IDs, I will read the IDs from state IDs by filter. Then I can use the same technique as before and map the IDs to state by ID look up table to get the actual to-dos.My selector now expects by IDs and IDs by filter to be part of the combined state of the to-dos reducer. The to-dos reducer used to combine the look of table and a list of all IDs which I'm replacing with the list of IDs by filter. IDs by filter is a new combined reducer that I'm creating.It combines a separate list of IDs for every filter. So it's all IDs for the all filter, active IDs for active filter, and completed IDs for the completed filter.The existing all IDs reducer manages an array of IDs, but it handles at to-do action which we don't want to handle anymore, at least not yet, because for now we want to teach it to respond to the data fetched from the server.To handle the receive to-dos action, we want to return a new array of to-dos that we get from the server response. I map the response which is an array of to-dos to a function that just selects an ID from the to-do. We decided to keep all IDs separate from active IDs and completed IDs, so they are fetched completely independently.I'm adding a new reducer called active IDs that also keeps track of an array of IDs, but for to-dos on the active tab. If we think about which actions it needs to handle, we'll realize that it also needs to handle received to-dos action in exactly the same way as all the IDs before it. Both active IDs and all IDs need to return a new state when the received to-dos action fires.However, we need to have a way of telling which ID array we should update.If you recall the receive to-dos action, you might remember that we passed the filter as part of the action. This lets me compare the filter inside the action with a filter that corresponds to the reducer. The all IDs reducer is only interested in the actions with the all filter.Similarly, the active IDs reducer only wants to replace the state when the filter in the action is equal to active. Finally, I can copy and paste my active IDs reducer to get a stub for my completed IDs reducer. I'll just place the word active with the word completed.Now that I wrote all the reducers managing the IDs, I need to update the by ID reducer to actually handle the new to-dos from the response. I'm removing the existing cases because the data does not live locally anymore. Instead, I'll handle the received to-do action just like I do in the other reducers.I'm creating a shallow copy of the state object which corresponds to the lookup table. For every to do object in the response, I want to take it and put it into the next version of the lookup table. I'm replacing whatever is in the next state by to-do ID with the new to-do I just fetched.Finally, I can return the next version of the lookup table from my reducer. Normally the assignment operation is a mutation. However it's fine because next state is a shallow copy, and we're only assigning one level deep. So we're not modifying any of the original state objects. The function itself stays pure.As the last step, I can remove the existing to-do reducer because the logic for adding and toggling to-dos will be implemented as API calls to the server in the future lessons.Let's run the app and inspect how the state changes. Before the action, the original state object contains the to-dos object with an empty lookup table and empty arrays of IDs for every filter. The action object contains the filter and the server response corresponding to this filter with to-do objects inside of it.After handling the action, the to-dos object contains the updated lookup table that has every to-do by its ID, as well as an updated list of IDs by filter where we only have fetched the old to-dos so far, so we have the IDs for all to-dos, but the other filters are amped in.If I change the tab now, it will make another API request and store these IDs separately from the all IDs. Inside the action object, the filter is active now. The response contains only one active to-do.Inside the next state object, the to-dos by ID lookup table is essentially the same because we have not received any new to-dos. However, the IDs by filter object now contains an array of IDs for all filter and a separate array of IDs for the active filter.We have filter and logic to the server, so switching a tab for the first time will take some time for the answers to load. However the next switch is filled instantaneous because we have cached the array of the fetched IDs. Even though we refresh them by fetching them again, the UI can already render the previous version of the array.Let's recap how we updated this state in response to the action with the fetch data. The state shape of the by ID reducer stayed the same. It's still a mapping of to-do IDs to the to-do objects. However, now it handles the received to-dos action when they are fetched from the server.It creates a shallow copy of the current mapping so that it can efficiently reassign its fellows inside a loop. It is a shallow copy. The assignment is only one level deep. So while this is limitation, it does not modify any of the original state objects. So the reducer function stays pure.The action response field is an array of to-dos fetched from the server, so they get merged into the lookup table managed by by ID.Next, I created a separate reducer for every collection of IDs. They all handle the received to-dos action, but to make sure that they handle only the IDs they're interested in, we check the filter.The action response field is an array of to-dos, so we map them to their IDs. The reducers handling to-do IDs handle received to-dos action in the same way but check for different filters. We have the all IDs for the all filter, the active IDs reducer for the active filter, and the completed IDs reducer for the completed filter.Finally, I'm using combine reducers to combine all of them into single IDs by filter reducer. I use the filter values as the keys so that the corresponding state appears under those keys.For example, to read the IDs corresponding to all filter, I can read state IDs by filter and pass all as a dynamic key. In order for IDs by filter to be in the state, I combine the to-dos reducer from by ID and IDs by filter combined reducer.This last my get visible to-do selector read the IDs for the corresponding filter and map them to the lookup table to get an array of to-do objects that we can return to the components."},"lessons/javascript-redux-refactoring-the-reducers.html":{"url":"lessons/javascript-redux-refactoring-the-reducers.html","title":"javascript-redux-refactoring-the-reducers","keywords":"","body":"Earlier, we removed the visibility filter reducer, and so the root reducer in the app now combines only a single todos reducer. Since index.js acts effectively as a proxy to the todos reducer, I will just remove index.js completely, and I will rename todos.js to index.js, thereby making the todos my new root reducer.The root reducer file now contains ById, all IDs, active IDs, and completed IDs, and I'm going to extract some of them into separate files. I'm starting with ById reducer, and I'm creating the file called ById.js, where I paste this reducer and export it as a default export.I'm also adding a named export for a selector called get todo, that takes the state and ID, where the state corresponds to the state of ById reducer. Now I'm going back to my index.js file, and I can import the reducer as a default import, and I can import any associated selectors in a single object with a namespace import.If we take a look at the reducers managing the IDs, we will notice that their code is almost exactly the same except for the filter value which they compare action filter to. I will create a new function called create list that takes filter as an argument.It returns another function, a reducer that handles the IDs for the specified filter, so its state shape is an array, and I can copy-paste the implementation from all IDs.

I added a new file called create list. I pasted my create list function there, and I will export it as a default export.Now that it's in a separate file, I'm adding a public API for accessing the state in form of a selector. That is called get IDs, and for now, it just returns the state of the list, but this may change in the future.Now I will go back to my index.js file, and I will import create list just like I usually import reducers, and I will import any named selectors from this file, as well.I'm renaming the IDs by filter reducer to list by filter, because now that the list implementation is in a separate file, I'll consider its state structure to be opaque, and to get the list of IDs, I will use the get IDs selector that it exports.Since I also moved the ById reducer into a separate file, I also don't want to make an assumption that it's just a lookup table, and I will use from ById, get todo selector that it exports and pass its state and the corresponding ID.This lets me change the state shape of any reducer in the future without rippling changes across the code base. Let's recap how we refactored the reducers.First of all, the todos reducer is now the root reducer of the application, and its file has been renamed to index.js. We extracted the ById reducer into a separate file.The ById reducer is now declared here, and it is exported from this module as a default export. To encapsulate the knowledge about the state shape in this file, we export a new selector that just gets the todo by its ID from the lookup table.We also created a new function called create list that we use to generate the reducers, managing the lists of fetched todos for any given filter.Inside createlist.js, we have a create list function that takes filter as an argument, and it returns a reducer that manages the fetched IDs for this filter.The generated reducers will handle the received todos action, but they will keep any action that has the filter different from the one they were created with.Create list is the default export from this file, but we also export a selector that gets the IDs from the current state. Right now, the IDs are the current state, but we are free to change this in the future.In index.js, we use the namespace import syntax to grab all selectors from the corresponding file into an object. The list by filter reducer combines the reducers generated by create list, and it uses the filters as the keys.Because list by filter is defined in this file, the get visible todo selector can make assumptions about its state shape and access it directly. However, the implementation of create list is in a separate file, so this is why it uses the from list get ID selector to get the IDs from it.Now that we have the IDs, we want to map them to the todos inside the state by ID. But now that it's in a separate file, rather than reach into it directly, we use the selector that it exports to access the [inaudible 6:03] todo.Redux does not enforce that you encapsulate the knowledge about the state shape in particular reducer files. However, it's a nice pattern, because it lets you change the state that is stored by reducers without having to change your components or your tests if you use selectors together with reducers in your tests."},"lessons/javascript-redux-displaying-loading-indicators.html":{"url":"lessons/javascript-redux-displaying-loading-indicators.html","title":"javascript-redux-displaying-loading-indicators","keywords":"","body":"When the data is fetched asynchronously, we want to display some kind of visual cue to the user. I'm adding a condition to the render function that says that if we're fetching data, and we have no to-dos to show, we're going to return something like a loading indicator from the render function.I will grab to-dos and is fetching from the props. In fact, to-dos is the only extra prop we need to pass to the list. Instead of using the spread operator, I'll just pass the to-dos directly. My maps data props function already calculates the visible to-dos, and it includes the to-dos in the props.I need to do something similar for is fetching. Get is fetching accepts the current state of the app, and the filter for which we want to check if the to-dos are being fetched. It is declared alongside other top level selectors in the top level reducer file.I am now switching to the root reducer file to add another exported named function, which is the new selector called get is fetching. It accepts the state of the app and the filter as our commands. It delegates to another selector to find and create list that gets whether this list is currently being fetched.I am passing the state of this list, which I get from state list by filter. I am using a selector that I have not created yet. I will go to createthis.js and add it. First, I need to modify the state shape of the list. Rather than assume the state is the array of IDs, I will assume it is an object that contains this array as a property.Now I can add another selector called get is fetching that reads another property from the state object, which is a built-in flag called is fetching. I want my reducer to keep track of both of these fields. Rather than complicate the existing reducer, I will rename it to IDs, because it manages just the IDs.I will create a separate reducer called is fetching that manages just the state of the fetching flag. Its initial state is false, and it looks just like any other reducer. I am now scrolling up to add an import for the combine reducers utility from Redux.Now I can return a combined reducer from create list that manages both IDs and is fetching. The is fetching reducer implementation is very simple. We switch on the action type, and if it is request to-dos, we'll return true because we started fetching.If it's received to-dos, we'll return false because the operation has finished. For any unknown action, we'll return the current state. Now I'm scrolling back up to the IDs reducer, and I will copy the condition that tells it to ignore any actions with a filter that does not match the filter argument to create list.Finally, I'm handling the request to-dos action, but I'm not dispatching it anywhere. In the file where I define the action creators, I am adding a new exported function called request to-dos that takes the filter and returns an action object describing the request to-dos action with the corresponding filter.Every exported action creator from this file will be available on the props of the visible to-do list component. I can just structure request to-dos from the props, and I can call it right before starting the asynchronous operation with fetch to-dos.If I run the app now, I will see not one, but two actions, request to-dos, and receive to-dos. If I look at the state after the request to-dos action, I will see that inside the all list state, is fetching flag is set to true.When the corresponding receive to-dos action fires, the flag gets reset back to false, and the IDs are not an empty array anymore. As I navigate the tabs for the first time, I see the loading indicator show up. However, if I visit them again, I already have cached data. I prefer to show that to a loading indicator.Let's recap. In the component, I dispatch an action called request to-dos before fetching them. The request to-dos action creator returns an action object with a type of request to-dos, and the filter that I passed.I handle the request to-dos action inside is fetching reducer, where it returns true if we began fetching. As soon as we receive the to-dos, it returns false, so that the loading indicator can reset. The is fetching reducer is combined with the IDs reducer into a single reducer that is returned from create list.The state shape of the combined reducer contains both IDs and is fetching. We can use these fields in the corresponding selectors. State is fetching is returned by get is fetching selector inside create list. Every list is independent.The top level selector calls it with a slice of the state corresponding to the list for the given filter. The top level get is fetching selector is called from the component in maps data props.Finally, we use the is fetching prop inside the render function of our component to render a loading indicator if we are fetching, and there are no cached to-dos to show."},"lessons/javascript-redux-dispatching-actions-asynchronously-with-thunks.html":{"url":"lessons/javascript-redux-dispatching-actions-asynchronously-with-thunks.html","title":"javascript-redux-dispatching-actions-asynchronously-with-thunks","keywords":"","body":"To show the loading indicator, I dispatch the request todos action before I fetch the todos. It would be great if I could make request todos dispatched automatically when I fetch the todos because I never want to fire them separately.I'm removing the explicit request todos dispatch from the component, and in the file where I define the action creators, I'm no longer exporting request todos action creator.I want to dispatch request todos when they start fetching, and receive todos when they finish fetching, but the fetch todos action creator only resolves through the receive todos action.An action promise resolves through a single action at the end, but we want an abstraction that represents multiple actions dispatched over the period of time. This is why rather than return a promise, I want to return a function that accepts a dispatch callback argument.This lets me call dispatch as many times as I like at any point of time during the async operation. I can dispatch the request todos action in the beginning, and when the promise resolves, I can explicitly dispatch another receive todos action at the end.This means more typing than returning a promise, but it also gives me more flexibility. A promise can only express one async value, so fetch todos now returns a function with a callback argument so that it can call it multiple times during the async operation.Such functions returned from other functions are often called thunks, so we're going to implement a thunk middleware to support them. I'm opening the configure store file where I define the middleware, and I will remove the promise middleware, and I will replace it with a different middleware that I'm going to write now.The new middleware I'm writing is called the thunk middleware because it supports the dispatching of thunks, and it takes the store, the next middleware, and the action as current arguments, just like any other middleware.If the action is not an action, but rather a function, we're going to assume that this is a thunk that wants the dispatch function to be injected into it, so I'm calling the action with store dispatch. Otherwise, I'm just going to return the result of passing the action to the next middleware in chain.As a final step, I need to add the thunk middleware I just wrote to my array of middlewares so that it gets applied to the store. Let's recap how thunk middleware lets us dispatch multiple actions asynchronously.The thunk middleware has the same signature as all Redux middlewares. It accepts the store, the next dispatch function, and the action as carried arguments. It returns a new dispatch function that checks if the action is actually a function itself.We can see that this is the case with fetch todos action creator. Its return value is a function that wants dispatch as its argument so that it can dispatch multiple times.This is why when we see an action that is really a function, a thunk, we call it with store dispatch as an argument so that it can dispatch other actions by itself. The store dispatch function becomes available as the dispatch argument inside the thunk.Now, the thunk can use the dispatch argument to dispatch the request todos action in the very beginning, and receive todos action at the very end. The dispatch function injected into thunks is already wrapped with the whole middleware chain, so thunks can dispatch both plain object actions and other thunks.No matter what gets dispatched, it will go through the middleware chain again, and if its type is a function, it will be called like a thunk, but otherwise, it will be passed on to the next middleware in chain.In this case, it's the logger. Only plain object actions reach the logger, and then reach the reducers. The thunk middleware is a powerful, composable way to express async action creators that want to emit several actions during the course of an async operation.This lets the components specify the intention to start an async operation without worrying which actions get dispatched and when."},"lessons/javascript-redux-avoiding-race-conditions-with-thunks.html":{"url":"lessons/javascript-redux-avoiding-race-conditions-with-thunks.html","title":"javascript-redux-avoiding-race-conditions-with-thunks","keywords":"","body":"I'm increasing the delay in my fake API client to five seconds. This lets me notice a problem. We don't check if the tab is already loading before starting a request, and then a bunch of receive todos action comes back, potentially resulting in a race condition.To fix this, I can exit early from the fetch todos action creator if I know that I'm already fetching the todos for the given filter. I will use the existing top level get is fetching selector, that accepts the store state and the filter as arguments. If it returns true, I will exit early from my thunk without dispatching any actions.The get is fetching selector is defined inside the top level reducer file. I will import it as a named import from reducers. Another function I'm using that isn't defined in this file is get state, and it belongs to the store object, but I don't have access, truly, directly from the action creator.However, I can make it so that the thunk middleware injects not just store dispatch function inside the thunk actions, but also store get state function. This way, I can grab it as a second argument after dispatch inside my thunk action creator, so I'm adding get state as a second argument.The fetch todos action creator now dispatches actions conditionally, and if I run the app, I can't get it to produce more than three concurrent requests.Only after the corresponding receive todos actions come back, the is fetching flag gets reset, and we can request the new todos. This is a good way to avoid unnecessary network operations and potential race conditions.This is a very common pattern, so you don't have to write the thunk middleware yourself. Instead, you can open up a terminal and run npm install save redux-thunk.It installs the thunk middleware that is very similar to the one I wrote here, so I can remove my version of thunk middleware, and instead, I can import thunk from redux-thunk.Finally, let's take a look at the return value of the thunk. It returns a promise. It doesn't have to, but it's convenient for the calling code, so I will change the early return to also return a promise that resolves immediately.The thunk middleware itself does not use this promise, but it becomes the return value of dispatching this action creator, so I can use it inside the component to schedule some code after the asynchronous action has completed.Let's recap how we use redux-thunk to dispatch actions asynchronously and conditionally. In the component, we dispatch the fetch todos action, which is implemented as an asynchronous action creator that returns a thunk that is a function that will get interpreted by the redux-thunk middleware.I import thunk from the redux-thunk package I installed from npm, and I added thunk to the list of redux middlewares I use to create my store. The thunk middleware sees that I dispatched a function rather than an action, so it calls it with dispatch as an argument so that it can dispatch multiple times.It also passes a second argument called get state that lets me get the current state of the redux store. I pass the state to the get is fetching selector that I import as a top level named import from the reducers file.I am passing the current state of the store and the filter to get is fetching, and if I am already fetching the todos for this filter, then I will exit early from the thunk so that I don't call the API or dispatch any actions.Finally, the thunk middleware has no opinion on what you return from the thunk itself. As a convention, I prefer to always return a promise that represents the corresponding asynchronous operation, whether or not it has called the server.The return value of the thunk becomes the return value of dispatching this thunk, and I can use this to wait for the asynchronous operation to finish inside my component in order to show a message or start an animation."},"lessons/javascript-redux-displaying-error-messages.html":{"url":"lessons/javascript-redux-displaying-error-messages.html","title":"javascript-redux-displaying-error-messages","keywords":"","body":"Sometimes API requests fail, and I will simulate this by throwing inside the fake API client so that it returns a reject promise. If I run the app the loading indicator gets stuck because isFetch and flag get set to two, but there is no corresponding receive todos action to set it to falls back again.To fix this, I will start with the action creators file. First of all, I'll do a little cleanup. The request todos action is never used outside of fetch todos so I want to embed the object literal right inside fetch todos for clarity.I will do the same for receive todos. I will copy the object literal for received todos action and paste it where I dispatch it inside fetch todos so it's easier to see the flow of fetch todos action. I want to tweak the indentation a little bit to prepare for adding the second argument to promise.then method, the rejection handler.Now with fetch todos action creator dispatches quite a bit of actions, I want to rename them to a consistent name in scheme such as fetch todos request, for request in the todos, fetch todo success, for successful fetch in the todos and fetch todo failure for failing to fetch the todos.I will pass two additional pieces of data, the filter and the error message, that I get the reading the error message field if specified or something went wrong as a fallback. The fetch todos action creator now handles all the cases.I can also remove the old action creators that I have aligned into it. If I change the action types, I also need to change the corresponding reducers so I'm opening the IDs reducer and rather than handle receive todos it now needs to handle fetch todos success.I also need to change the isFetch in reducer. I'm renaming the request todos the \"fetch todos request\" and receive todos \"the fetch todos success.\" I also want to handle fetch todos failure and return of holds so that the loading indicator doesn't get stuck.The last reducer I need to change is by ID, and I just replace receive todos with fetch todo success. If I run the app now the loading indicator does not get stuck, because a corresponding failure action fires and so isFetching gets reset back to false again.Let's display the error to the user. I have created a new file where I import react. I'm declaring a new functional status component called fetch error that takes the message as a prop, which is a string, and on retry as a prop, which is a function.The render deep will contain the children, an error saying that something bad happened including the message that is passed in the props, and a button that when clicked will invoke the on retry callback prop so that the user can retry fetching the data.I am exporting this component as a default export from fetch error, and I'm going to the visible todo list where I want to use it. I'm adding fetch error as an import to the visible todo list, and I'm scrolling down to the render method.I will need the error message which I'm de-structuring from the props of visible todo list component, and inside the render method I will add another condition saying that if we have an error message in our props and we have no todos to display then I'm going to return the fetch error component.The fetch error component itself wants a message prop which I can pass the error message prop I just de-structured and an on retry callback prop for which I will pass an error function that calls this fetch data to restart the data fetching process.In order to get the error message into the props I'll need to scroll down to my maps data props implementation and put it there. I will use the same pattern as I currently do with isFetching, and I will get the error message prop by calling a selector called get error message passing the state of the app and the filter.The get error message selector does not exist yet so I need to scroll up to where I import the selectors from the root reducers file, and I will add a get error message alongside get isFetching. Inside the root reducers file I'm copy/paste in the get isFetching selector, and I'm changing the name to get error message. It will also delegate to a selector with a same name defined in the create List.js.Inside create List.js, I'm adding a new exported selector called get error message that takes the state of the list and returns a property called error message. Finally, I need to add a reducer managing the error message field which I will add to the combined reducer later.I'm declaring a new reducer called error message with the initial state of now. A reducer cannot have undefined initial state so I have to make its absence explicit. Like in the other reducers in this file, I want to skip any actions with the filter that doesn't match the filter specified as an argument to create list.When the filter matches, I want to handle a few actions. I would like to display an error message whenever I get a failure so I handle a fetch todos failure by returning the message embedded the action.If the user retries a request I want to clear the error message so I handle a fetch this request and fetch this success by returning null. Finally, for any other action, I'll just return the current state. The error message reducer needs to be added to the combined reducer for the list so that its state becomes available on the list state object.Now I will change my API layer so it doesn't throw every time. This way I'll get a chance to test how well the retry button works. If I run the app now, I can see the failure action being omitted with the corresponding message.Thanks to the new reducer, this message will now make its way into the next state inside list by filter all error message and so the component can display it. If I press the retry button, the request action will clear the error message and then the success action will populate the list of todos.Let's recap how we handle errors for every list independently. Inside the fake API client, I randomly throw an error so fetch reduce returns a rejected promise once in a while. Having separate action creators for request success and failure cases seemed like overkill. I in-lined the corresponding action objects right inside the [inaudible 7:34] action creator.I also renamed them to fetch this request, fetch todo success, and I added a new fetch todos failure action so that we can reset the loading indicator and display the error message.I am passing the rejection handler as a second argument to the promise.then method. If the promise returned by the API gets rejected, this function will be called with the error as the argument.You might have seen a different way of handling promise errors in some examples where only one argument is passed and then you call catch on the resulting promise. The downside of this approach is if one of your reducers or describe components throws while handling this action you'll get into the sketch block and so you'll display an internal error message to the user.To avoid this error, I recommend that you don't use catch in this scenario and just pass the second argument so it catches only the errors from the underlying API promise. The error object usually comes with a message that we can wrap or display directly to the user with a fallback.We make it available to the reducers as the message field on the action object. I renamed the action types so I also needed to update the reducer inside by ID js and the reducers inside create this js to use the new names.We only want to update the IDs on a successful fetch. However, we want to update the indicator in all three cases. In particular, I reset the loading indicator both on success and on failure. I also added a new reducer that keeps track of the error message for the given tab.When the request fails, its state becomes the message from the action. But if it succeeds or if a new request starts, it is reset to null. Like in other reducers in this file, we are only handling actions that have the same filter as the filter this list was created with.The return combined reducer now manages both isFetching and the currently displayed error message. This lets me add a new selected call get error message that just reads the error message field from the combined state object.I'm calling this selector from the top level reducer file, and I'm passing the slice of the state corresponding to the list for the specified filter. The top level get error message selector will be called inside maps state to props of the visible todo list component.It receives the global state and the current filter as arguments, and the result will be available as error message prop inside the visible todo list components render function.I'm de-structuring the error message from the props, and if I have an error message and no todo list to show I will render the fetch error component passing the error message and a function that refetches the data as the props.Finally, I created a new component called fetch error that displays the message from the props and renders a button that lets the user retry the fetch action."},"lessons/javascript-redux-creating-data-on-the-server.html":{"url":"lessons/javascript-redux-creating-data-on-the-server.html","title":"javascript-redux-creating-data-on-the-server","keywords":"","body":"I added a couple of new functions to the fake API client, in addition to fetch todos, to prepare for this and the next lessons.The first new fake API endpoint is called add todo. It simulates a network connection, and then it creates a new todo object. It puts the todo with the given text into the fake database, and it returns the todo object, just like rest endpoints normally do.The second fake API endpoint I added is called toggle todo. It also simulates a network connection, and it finds the corresponding todo in the fake database and flips its completed field, also returning the todo as the response.In this lesson, we will make the add todo button called the add todo fake API endpoint. I'm opening the file with action creators, I will no longer need the V4 function because the ID generation now occurs on the server, and instead, I will call the API to add the todo.I'm changing the add todo action creator to be a func action creator, so I'm adding dispatch as a carried argument. The func will call the API add todo endpoint with the given text, and wait for the response to come back.When the response is available, it will dispatch an action with the type add todo success, and the server response. The newly added todo will be part of the server response, so I need to change the byId reducer to merge it into the lookup table that it manages.I am adding a new case for the add todo success action. I'm using the object spread operator to create a new version of the lookup table, where under the action response ID key, there is a new todo object that I read from action response.If I run the app now and add a todo, it will not appear in the list immediately. I can see the add todo success action in the log, and if I inspect the next state, I will see that the byId lookup table now contains all four todos.However, we have not updated the list by filter, so all still only has three IDs in the list. If I go to another tab, the new todo appears because its ID is now included in the list of fetched IDs, and similarly, if I go back to the previous tab, it appears now because the data has been re-fetched.The list of IDs for each tab is managed by a reducer defined inside createlist.js. I will change the IDs reducer to handle the add todo success action.When I receive a confirmation that the todo has been added on the server, I can return a new list of IDs with existing IDs in the beginning, and a newly added ID at the very end. Unlike the other actions, add todo success does not have a filter property on the action object, so our initial check would fail.I am removing the top level check, and I will replace it with different checks in different cases. I want to replace the fetched IDs if the filter in the action matches the filter of this list. However, I want the newly added todo to appear in every list except the completed filter, because a newly added todo is not completed.If I run the app now, I can see that if I add a new todo, it appears in the list as soon as add todo success action is dispatched, even though the last time todos were fetched, the new item wasn't there yet.It will also appear immediately in the active list, before the active todos are even fetched. It will not, however, appear in the completed list because we know that newly added todos are not completed.If I add a new todo while I'm looking at the completed list, it will not appear there even though the add todo success action has been dispatched, because new todos are not completed. However, if I switch to active or all, I will see it immediately, even before the corresponding list has been fetched.Let's recap the changes necessary for adding todo asynchronously. We handle fetch todo success only if the action filter matches the filter that the list was created with, and in this case, we replace the fetched list of todos. Otherwise, we just return the current state.However, to handle add todo success, we want to check if the filter is not completed, because if we add a todo, it will not be completed, and we want it to appear at the end of the all and the active filter lists.I also updated the byId reducer that manages the lookup table to handle add todo success action. We read the add todo from the action response, and we return a new version of the lookup table that contains it under its ID.Finally, the add todo action creator is no longer synchronous, and instead, it returns a func that calls add todo API endpoint and dispatches an action with the type add todo success and the response from the server."},"lessons/javascript-redux-normalizing-api-responses-with-normalizr.html":{"url":"lessons/javascript-redux-normalizing-api-responses-with-normalizr.html","title":"javascript-redux-normalizing-api-responses-with-normalizr","keywords":"","body":"In the by ID reducer, I currently have to handle different server actions in a different way, because they have different response shape. For example, the fetch to-do success action has a response, which is an array of to-dos.I have to iterate over them and merge them one by one into the next state. Add to-do success is different. The response for adding a to-do is the to-do itself. I have to merge a single to-do in a different way.Instead of adding new cases for every new API call, I want to normalize the responses so the response shape is always the same.I'm running NPM install, save Normalizer, which is a utility library that helps me normalize API responses to have the same shape. I'm creating a new file in the actions directory called \"schema.js.\" I'm importing a schema constructor, and a function called array of from Normalizer.I will export two schemas from this file. I create a schema for the to-do objects, and specify to-dos as the name of the dictionary in the normalized response. I also create another schema called array of to-dos that corresponds to the responses that contain arrays of to-do objects.Next, I am opening the file where I define action creators, and I am adding a named import for a function called \"normalize\" that I import from Normalizer. I also add a namespace import for all the schemas I defined in the schema file.I'm scrolling down to the fetch to-do success callback, and adding a normalized response log so that I can see what the normalized response looks like. I'm calling the normalize function with the original response as the first argument, and the corresponding schema -- in this case, array of to-dos -- as the second argument.Next, I'm scrolling down to the add to-do success handler. When the response comes back, I want to log the normalized response by calling the normalize function with the original response as the first argument, and the corresponding schema -- in this case, a schema for a single to-do -- as the second argument.If I run the app now and look at the response in the action, I will see an array of to-do objects, however, a normalized response for fetch to-do success action looks differently. It contains two fields called entities and result.Entities contains a normalized dictionary called \"to-dos\" that contains every to-do in the response by its ID. Normalizer found these to-do objects in the response by following the array of to-dos schema. Conveniently, they are indexed by IDs, so they will be easy to merge into the lookup table.The second field is the result. It's an array of to-do IDs. They are in the same order as the to-dos in the original response array. However, Normalizer replaced each to-do with its ID, and moved every to-do into the to-dos dictionary.Normalizer can do this for any API response shape. For example, let's add a to-do. The original action response object will be the to-do itself, as returned by the server. The normalized response will contain two fields, just like before, entities and result.Like before, the entities object will contain the to-dos dictionary, this time with a single item. In the result field, we will see just the ID of the to-do, because the original response is just the single to-do, and Normalizer replaced it with its ID in the result field.I will now change the action creator so that they pass the normalized response in the response field, instead of the original response.As a reminder, we have to pass the schema as the second argument, and its schema to-do for the single to-do, and its schema array of to-dos for the array of to-do objects in the response.Now, I can open the by ID reducer, and I can delete these special cases, because the response shape is going to be very similar. Rather than switch by action type, I will check if the action has a response object on it.I will return a new version of the lookup table that contains all existing entries, as well as any entries inside entities to-dos in the normalized response. For other actions, I will return the lookup table as it is.Now, I need to switch to the IDs reducer to amend it to understand the new action response shape. For fetched to-dos, it used to be an array of to-dos. For add to-do, it used to be the to-do itself.Now, the action response has a result filled, which is already an array of IDs, in case of fetch this success, and our single ID of the fetched to-do in case of add to-do success.I can run the app now, and inspect the action response. I can see that, for fetched to-do success, the response contains the entities which contains the to-dos by their IDs, and the result is an array of IDs in the same order as they were in the original response.I can also add a to-do, and the action response will also contain the entities and the result, where the entities contains the to-dos by their IDs, in this case, a single to-do. The result is the ID of the added to-do.Let's recap how to work with normalized responses. Fetch to-do success original response contained an array of to-dos. Normalizer replaces them with an array of their IDs in the result field. The add to-do success original response was a single to-do, so action response result becomes its ID.Inside the by ID reducer, I removed all the special cases for different action types. I just check if the action contains a normalized response. The entities field will contain different dictionaries. In this example, I only have a single to-dos dictionary, which corresponds to the objects with a to-do schema.I use the object spread operator to merge the old lookup table and the newly-fetched to-dos. The name of the dictionary inside entities corresponds to the string argument that I passed to the schema constructor when I created the to-do schema.I have two kinds of API responses in my app, a single to-do, and an array of to-dos. I use the array all function from Normalizer to create a corresponding array schema.Finally, in the action creators, I call the normalize function to get the normalized response from the original response, and the schema that I know corresponds to this API endpoint.I know that the original response from fetch to-dos is an array of to-do objects. I pass the array of to-dos schema. The add to-do response shape is a single to-do item. I pass the schema for a single to-do to the normalize function that I import from Normalizer."},"lessons/javascript-redux-updating-data-on-the-server.html":{"url":"lessons/javascript-redux-updating-data-on-the-server.html","title":"javascript-redux-updating-data-on-the-server","keywords":"","body":"I am changing the toggle todo action creator to be a func action creator, so I'm adding dispatch as a carried argument. I'm calling the toggle todo API endpoint, and waiting for the response to come back.When the response is available, I will dispatch an action with the type toggle todo success, and the response. However, I will normalize the response first by passing the original response as the first argument, and the todo schema as the second argument.Now let's run the app. I will clear the console and toggle the todo. The UI updates when the toggle todo success action is dispatched because the action contains a normalized response in which the corresponding todo has a completed field set to true, so the ById reducer merges the new version of the todo into the current state of the lookup table.This is the benefit of normalizing the API responses. Updates to the entities get merged automatically. I can switch to the completed tab to verify that the server state has indeed been updated.I will clear the console, and then toggle the todo while I'm on the completed tab. After the toggle todo success action, the corresponding todo in the ById lookup table has been updated, and now has completed set to false. However, it is still visible in the completed list because we have not refetched it, and so its ID is still there.I can force refetching by going to the active tab, and then going to the completed tab back again, and it will disappear. However, I would prefer if it disappeared immediately, so I'm opening the IDs reducer in createlist.js.I will add a new case for the toggle todo success action. I will extract the code for this case into a separate function called handle toggle, to which I pass the state and the action.I'm declaring a handle toggle function above the IDs reducer. It accepts the state and a ray of IDs, and the toggle todo success action.I'm destructuring the result as the toggled ID and the entities from the normalized response. Next, I am reading the completed value from the todo, which I get by referencing entities todos by the toggled ID.There are two cases in which I want to remove the todo from the list. The first case is when the completed field is true but the filter is active, so it shouldn't be there, and the other situation is when the completed is false but the filter is completed, so we want it to disappear.When should remove is true, I want to return a copy of the list that does not contain the ID of the todo that was just toggled, so I filter the list by ID and only leave the ones that have a different ID. Otherwise, I return the original array.If I run the app now and toggle the todo while I'm on the completed tab, it will disappear right after toggle todo success action, even though we have not refetched the todos since the last time.Similarly, I can open the active tab and toggle a todo there. It disappears after the toggle todo success action even though the active todos have not been refetched.Finally, I can open the all tab and toggle the todos back and forth, and since it doesn't have any special logic, they all stay there.Let's recap how we handle the toggle todo success action. I extracted a function called handle toggle, and it makes sure that the toggle todo is immediately removed from the lists that shouldn't contain it.I'm reading the ID of the toggle todo from the result field populated by a normalizer. Next, I'm reading the completed field from the updated todo inside the todos dictionary in the normalized response.I want to remove the todo in two cases, if it's completed but we're looking at the list of active todos, or if it's not completed but we're looking at the list of the completed todos.The handle toggle function is called from the toggle todo success case inside the IDs reducer. I did not need to change any code inside the ById reducer because any updated todos get merged into the new version of the lookup table automatically.The only other place I needed to change is the toggle todo action creator. I change it to be a func action creator by adding a carried dispatch argument, and I made it call the toggle todo API endpoint.When the response is available, it dispatches the toggle todo success action, with the normalized response that I get by calling normalized with the response, and a single todo schema."},"lessons/javascript-redux-using-mapdispatchtoprops-shorthand-notation.html":{"url":"lessons/javascript-redux-using-mapdispatchtoprops-shorthand-notation.html","title":"javascript-redux-using-mapdispatchtoprops-shorthand-notation","keywords":"","body":"The mapDispatchToProps function let's us inject certain props into the React component that can dispatch actions. For example, the TodoList component calls itsonTodoClick` callback prop with the ID of the Todo.TodoList.jsconst TodoList =({ todos, onTodoClick }) => (\n  \n    {todos.map(todo =>\n       onTodoClick(todo.id)}\n      /> \n    )}\n  \n);\nInside mapDispatchToProps we specify that when onTodoClick is called with an ID, we want to dispatch the toggleTodo action with this ID. The toggleTodo action creator uses this ID to generate an action object that will be dispatched.VisibleTodoList.js\nWhen the arguments for the callback prop match the arguments to the action creator exactly, there is a shorter way to specify mapDispatchToProps.Rather than pass a function, we can pass a special object, a map, in between the names of the callback props that we want to inject and the action creator functions that create the corresponding actions.This is a rather common case, so often you don't need to write mapDispatchToProps, and you can pass this map in object instead.Let's recap. Normally, mapDispatchToProps accepts the dispatch function as an argument so that you can return the props through inject into the React component that each can dispatch certain actions using the dispatch function.However, it is very common that the arguments passed through the callback props are passed through to the action creators in the same order. In this case, rather than write mapDispatchToProps function yourself, it can pass a configuration object that maps the names of the callback props to the corresponding action creator functions."}}}
