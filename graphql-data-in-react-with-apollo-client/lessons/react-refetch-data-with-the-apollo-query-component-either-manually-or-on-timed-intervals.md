So far, we used `data`, `loading`, `error` from the render prop function of a `Query` component. There are a couple more utilities coming with this object. One of them is `refetch`. 


#### src/recipes.js
```js
<Query
  query={recipesQuery}
  variables={{ vegetarian: this.state.vegetarian }}
  pollInterval={3000}
>
  {({ data, loading, error, refetch }) => {
    if (loading) return <p>Loadingâ€¦</p>;
    if (error) return <p>Something went wrong</p>;

    return (
      ...
    )
  }
</Query>
```
Once invoked, it will rerun the query. Let's give this a try by adding a `<button>` to refresh to recipes.

```js
<React.Fragment>
  ...
  
  <button onClick={() => refetch()}> Refresh Recipes</button>
</React.Fragment>
```
Once implemented we add a new item in another browser, switch back to our previous one, and execute the refetch by pressing the button.

As expected, we now see the new recipe being added. Other examples of useful utilities coming inside the render prop, a network status, fetch more for pagination, or start and stop polling.

That said, the easiest way to achieve polling for new results is using the `pollInterval` prop on the `query` component itself. By default, it's deactivated, but if you provide a number like `{3000}`, the component will rerun the query every third second. 

```js
<Query
  query={recipesQuery}
  variables={{ vegetarian: this.state.vegetarian }}
  pollInterval={3000}
>
```

Again, you want to verify it by adding get another recipe.

As you can see, the banana muffin was added. Without web sockets being available, polling can be a simple and effective tool to provide an almost real time experience.
