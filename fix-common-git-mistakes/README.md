Asciicasts for [Chris Achard](https://egghead.io/instructors/chris-achard)'s course, Fix Common Git Mistakes on [egghead.io](https://egghead.io/courses/fix-common-git-mistakes)

## Description
This workshop will start by breaking down the four states in which a file can exist, and we'll build up our mental model of git from there. Then, we'll look at how to move files between those states in different ways.

Once we've developed a new model for how git operates, we'll be able to purposefully get ourselves into some sticky situations, and then gracefully recover from them.

Some of the common situations we'll look at are:

- Changing commit messages
- Adding or removing files from a commit
- How and when to stash changes
- What a "detached HEAD" is, and how to fix it
- Removing secrets from a codebase
- How to rewrite history

If you can handle git add/commit/push, but not much more - then this workshop is perfect for you.

You can finally get some proper git training, and will never have to worry about losing data or messing up the repo again!
