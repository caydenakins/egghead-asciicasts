Asciicasts for [Kent C. Dodds](https://egghead.io/instructors/kentcdodds)'s course, Simplify Real World React Apps with React Hooks and Suspense on [egghead.io](https://egghead.io//courses/simplify-real-world-react-apps-with-react-hooks-and-suspense)

## Description
With the massive improvements to function components in React via hooks and suspense, you may be interested in seeing how to refactor a typical class component to a simpler class component that uses React Suspense and Hooks features. In this course, Kent will take [a modern React codebase](https://github.com/kentcdodds/react-github-profile) that uses classes and refactor the entire thing to use function components as much as possible. Weâ€™ll look at state, side effects, async code, caching, and more!
