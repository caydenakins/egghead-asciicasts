In our command line, we're inside a directory called `utility-functions`, which is a git repository. Let's run the `git log` command. The `git log` command logs all of the commits in our repository with the most recent commits on top, and then older commits are you scroll down.

Taking a look at an individual commit, it consists of the `commit ID`, the `author` of the commit with the `author email`, the `date` the commit was made, as well as the `commit message`. When we run the `git log` command, we can pass an `{argument}`, which will let us either format the commits that are shown or filter down to a specific set of commits inside of our git log history.
