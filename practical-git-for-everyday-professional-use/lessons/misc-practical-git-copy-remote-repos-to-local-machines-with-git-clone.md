We've created a directory called Cool Project, and we've moved ourselves into the directory. If we take a look inside, there's nothing here yet. What we want to do is we want to pull down a remote Git repo and place it inside of this directory.
The remote repository that we want on our machine is located on GitHub, and right here we can see that there is this URL of where the remote is located. We're going to copy this. Now back in our Command Line, we can type Git Clone, and then paste in the URL that we copied from GitHub.
Now if we look at what's inside this folder, we can see that we have another folder called Utility Functions, which is our cloned repo. If we move into that folder, and we output what's inside of it, we can see that it has the .git directory.
We'd know that this is our Git repo from the remote. We also see that this folder contains a couple of files that contain our code. If we look back at our GitHub page, we can see that it's the same files that are located in the remote repository.
