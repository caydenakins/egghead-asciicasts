Asciicasts for [Matt Ross](https://egghead.io/instructors/matt-ross)'s course, Build a Neo4J & GraphQL API on [egghead.io](https://egghead.io//courses/build-a-neo4j-graphql-api)

## Description
In this course we will learn some of the basics of getting data into and out of Neo4J, as well as touch on some of the libraries and tooling available in the Neo4J community ecosystem, which we will leverage to quickly create and use a full-featured GraphQL API.

We will start by learning how to run and interact with Neo4J locally. Then we will develop a graph model in which to store the data that we pull from SWAPI via REST. We will then create an Apollo GraphQL API driven by a few simple schemas which fit into this model. We will then write some simple code to crawl SWAPI and insert the data into Neo4J through our GraphQL API. Once there is data in the store, we will learn about some of the features in `neo4j-graphql-js` that make connecting and accessing our graph Nodes easier.
