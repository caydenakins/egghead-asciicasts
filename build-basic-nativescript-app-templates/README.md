Asciicasts for Brad Martin's course on [egghead.io](https://egghead.io).

There are 6 transcripts, one transcript for each video.

## Description
In this course, we will learn how to use the core layouts for NativeScript apps. We will start with the basic principles of NativeScript layouts using XML. This course will use the app templates provided from the NativeScript framework and installed using [the NativeScript CLI](https://egghead.io/lessons/angular-1-x-set-up-a-native-app-project-with-the-nativescript-cli).

We will cover the following layouts: StackLayout, WrapLayout, GridLayout, DockLayout, AbsoluteLayout and FlexboxLayout. Understanding the concepts and usage of UI layouts in NativeScript is key for a great app.
