Instructor: [00:00] `CSS` is a language that controls how documents are presented on the Web to users. This means it controls how text, images, and other elements lay out on a page, how they respond to different devices, and so much more.

[00:14] We can write a quick example of `CSS` by styling some specific content to appear as the `color` `red` on the page. `CSS` has two main components. 

```css
h1 {
    color: red;
}
```

First, the selector and its corresponding block. This first statement is called a `selector`. This is how we tell the browser which elements of `HTML` we want to apply the defined styles to.

[00:35] Everything defined inside of these curly braces will apply to this `selector` only. These are also called `CSS` declaration blocks. Inside of these blocks are the `CSS` declarations.

[00:48] On the left-hand side of the colon, these are called `properties`. `Properties` are the feature of the page we want to style. In our case, we want to change the color feature of our `h1` `selector` to be the color red.

[01:01] On the right side of our colon, these are called `values`. Each property has a specific set of valid `values` that can be chosen to implement on a website. This is the how we want to change the defined feature.

[01:15] We end each `CSS` declaration with a semicolon. This is required, or the browser will not render the style correctly.
