Asciicasts for [Michel Weststrate's](https://egghead.io/instructors/michel-weststrate) course, MManage Application State with Mobx-state-tree on [egghead.io](https://egghead.io/courses/manage-application-state-with-mobx-state-tree).

There are 17 transcripts, one transcript for each video.

## Description

In this course, Michel Westrate - Creator of Mobx - will teach us how to model application state after your problem domain with Mobx-state-tree (MST). You will be able to manage the lifecycle of your data by describing data models. Models are like React components, but for data!

Finally you will see that MST allows you to solve certain problems generically by leveraging it's out of the box support for asynchronous actions, patches, snapshots and middleware.

This will be done through building a little bookshop application using React, Mobx-state-tree (MST) and create-react-app.
