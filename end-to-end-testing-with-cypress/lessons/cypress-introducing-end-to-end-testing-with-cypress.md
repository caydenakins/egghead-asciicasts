Instructor: [00:00] Testing applications in a real browser are incredibly valuable. Historically, the tools available to automate these tests have left a bit to be desired. Those tests control the browser as a black box, and as our application gets more complex, it gets harder to keep those tests from becoming flaky. We often end up manually testing our applications, which can be time-consuming, tedious, and costly. 

[00:22] In this course, we'll see how Cypress is changing all of that. Cypress allows us to create a reliable, flake-free tests that run in a real browser. All of this is done with a straightforward JavaScript API based on tools you may already be familiar with, like Mocha and the Chai Assertion Library. 

[00:38] Along with a simple API for automation, we also get a powerful UI that allows us to see what's happening in our application at each step of the test. Since we're running in a real browser, we get the benefit of Chrome's dev tools, right inside the TestRunner UI. 

[00:52] Once you've completed this course, you'll see how enjoyable it can be to write reliable integration and end-to-end tests for your application. It's all just an NPM install away.
