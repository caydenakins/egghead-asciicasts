## Description

Angular has many built-in features for working closely with RxJS to help you build fully reactive applications. This course will teach you how to use Angular with RxJS. We will learn how to use the ngrx/store library to manage state in a very clean reactive "Redux style".
This course assumes you've got a working knowledge of Angular and reactive programming with RxJS. If you don't, you might want to watch Get Started with Angular and this Introduction to Reactive Programming with RxJS.
