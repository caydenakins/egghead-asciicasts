## Description
In many cases, teams reach for Redux as the defacto standard choice for state management. Sometimes, though, Redux is overkill. In those cases, the React Context API might suit your needs perfectly.

In this course we’ll build a simple email client, using the React Context API to pass data throughout the app. You’ll learn how to create a context, how to pass data deeply through an app without manually passing props all over the place, and how to group related data and logic using simple wrapper components. We’ll also cover practical applications like using Context to display and manage notifications, how to maximize performance with Context, and how to test the components that use it to ensure your app is working properly.
