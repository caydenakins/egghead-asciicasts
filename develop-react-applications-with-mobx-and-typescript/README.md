## Description

As state management solutions go, MobX is famously the simplest one out there.

We like to keep things simple without using complicated setups like `provider` and `connect` that provide little value for much greater mental overhead. This course shows a simple and effective way to use MobX with TypeScript that we have used in large teams, that is proven to scale as much as you want, just like TypeSafe React / TSX.
