Asciicasts for [Juri Strumpflohner](https://egghead.io/instructors/juri-strumpflohner)'s course, Productive Git for Developers on [egghead.io](https://egghead.io//courses/productive-git-for-developers)

## Description
Knowing your everyday toolset increases your productivity as a developer. And Git is one of those tools you use on a daily basis. Mastering Git is tough; it has hundreds of different commands, often even inconsistent at how you pass in flags and configuration options. On the other side, there are a lot of good Git courses out there already, explaining all of these commands in detail. 

With this course, I aim at a different goal. You will walk through a series of scenarios which you’ll most commonly encounter in your daily work life as a developer. I’m talking:
 - updating your feature branch with the latest changes from master
 - polishing your git history to make it ready for being peer-reviewed
 - moving a set of commits to another branch
 - undoing accidental commits

The goal is not to cover everything, but those tasks that will greatly improve your daily productivity with Git.
