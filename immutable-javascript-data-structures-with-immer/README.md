Asciicasts for [Michel Weststrate](https://egghead.io/instructors/michel-weststrate) course, Immutable JavaScript Data Structures with Immer on [egghead.io](https://egghead.io/courses/immutable-javascript-data-structures-with-immer)

There are 20 transcripts out of 20, one transcript for each video.

## Description
Using immutable data to store state has many interesting benefits. Immutable data makes it easy to trace state over time. It can be distributed easily, and by leveraging structural sharing we can leverage optimization techniques such as memoization.

In this course we will build a multi user gift-list, in which we will discover how using immer doesnâ€™t just significantly simplifies our state manipulation code. It also provides us with very useful tools such as patches that can help us to distribute changes, build undo/ redo, etc.
