Instructor: 00:00 In this video course, we are going to study the Immer library. The Immer library makes working with immutable data a lot easier. For that reason, it has become really popular. In this course, we're going to go pretty deep.

00:13 Immer has a lot of features most people don't know about. In this course, we're going to build a small application in which someone can manage the gifts he wants to receive for his birthday, for example. Also, attendees can reserve the things that they want to be giving to make sure that people don't gift the same thing twice, and this application will become quite fancy.

00:38 It will, for example, be possible to have multiple users working on the very same application. What's even more, people will be able to do, undo, and redo without breaking its address changes. This whole application will be driven by immutable data which captures the state in Immer. However, let's start very simple, shall we?
