## Description
RxJS Subjects are a source of confusion for many people using RxJS. For many, the Subject is the obvious and only answer to every problem. Subjects are incredibly useful and necessary, but the key is to know when to use them for solving specific problems that you encounter.

In this course, we are going deep into RxJS Subjects and multicasting operators. You'll gain a solid understanding of when, where, and how to use these powerful tools.
