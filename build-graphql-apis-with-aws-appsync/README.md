## Description
Building a real world, scalable & production-ready GraphQL API is hard. In this course, we’ll learn how to create a production-ready GraphQL API that can handle everything from queries to mutations & subscriptions. We’ll also connect to our API from a React application and execute queries, mutations & subscriptions using the new API.
