Asciicasts for [Raphael Terrier](https://egghead.io/instructors/raphael-terrier)'s course, Getting started with Algolia InstantSearch.js on [egghead.io](https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-algolia-instantsearch-js)

## Description
This is an introductory course on Algolia search solution that will focus on the user facing part of search. We will cover how to build an engaging search experience in no time with Algolia InstantSearch.js  front-end library. 

Pre-requisits:
You do not need any previous knowledge in search to follow this course as we will be using an example index with an e-commerce data set preconfigured. We will work mainly in javascript throughout this course so a basic JS knowledge is expected.
If you want to play with your own index settings and data set, you can [create a free  Algolia account here](https://www.algolia.com/users/sign_up/hacker/?utm_medium=link&utm_source=egghead&utm_campaign=education), but this is not required to follow along this first course.
