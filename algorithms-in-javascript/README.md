## Description
Algorithms are functions that are used to solve a class of problems. Really any piece of code can be a algorithm! There are common algorithm implementations that have proven to accomplish tasks faster than others. However, speed is not measured in seconds but in terms of growth (Big O notation). 

This course is designed to teach not only some of those algorithmic approaches to everyday problems but review the pitfalls and optimizations that comes with using them at all. They can be a dynamic and powerful way to optimize calculations, processes, and performing tasks. However, if used incorrectly it can not only destroy a system but can be a nightmare to untangle. Many programming positions today test the knowledge of an individual’s ability to understand and implement algorithms. Let’s work through  recursion, sorting, loops, and many more!
