## Description
Let's start from scratch and build a full React application!

Building your first React application can be challenging. React itself is fairly simple. It has a small API that can be learned quickly. One of the huge challenges when you are getting started with React is all of the other pieces that contribute to creating an application.

In this series, we will go beyond React, and look at the full picture of what goes into a React application. We will use Webpack to build the application. We will use Firebase to persist data. We will dig into react-router for our applications routing.

When you've completed this series you will have built a full-blown web application using React, and should have the tools needed to start building your own applications today.
## Library Version
