Instructor: 00:00 Hi. My name is Isaac Mann. This is my Advanced Angular Component Patterns course. When we write components, we're encapsulating decisions about the state logic or UI of the app.

00:13 Each of the patterns I share in this course will help you to write components that are opinionated about their core purpose, but allow parent components to override secondary concerns.

00:24 Now if this course feels eerily similar to Kent C. Dodds' [Advanced React Component Patterns](https://egghead.io/courses/advanced-react-component-patterns) course, that's because I intentionally took the patterns he was applying in React, and looked for analogs in the angular world.

00:37 They're good patterns. They're just as useful in an angular app as they are in a React one. First, we'll see how to use input and output decorators to allow a parent component to interact with the internal state of the component.

00:50 Then, we'll explore using compound components to have more control over the UI of a component. We'll look at different ways of maintaining the state of the compound component, including using a provider component.

01:02 Next, we'll look at using TemplateRefs to offer complete UI control to the parent component. This is the equivalent of React's Render Prop Pattern. Finally, we'll see how to override the internal logic of a component using the State Reducer Pattern.

01:17 I hope you enjoy the course.
