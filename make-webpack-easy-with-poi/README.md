## Description
When setting up a modern JavaScript app, we find ourselves trudging through the land of infinite configuration. Poi offers us an option of zero-configuration by providing sane defaults and hiding them away until you need to tweak a change to suit your needs.

## Library Versions
[Webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/releases): 3.8.1

[Poi](https://poi.apache.org/changes.html#3.17): 3.17
