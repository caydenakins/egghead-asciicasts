Asciicasts for [Chris Achard](https://egghead.io/instructors/chris-achard)'s course, Progressive Web Apps in React with create-react-app on [egghead.io](https://egghead.io//courses/progressive-web-apps-in-react-with-create-react-app)

## Description
Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) allow a user to use your web app online or offline, and lets them install the app onto their iOS or Android device just like a native app.  Sounds great, right?  But it can be tricky to properly configure a PWA, and not every feature works on every browser or device.

In this course, we’ll create an online/offline note taking app.  We’ll use `create-react-app` to create the frontend, and node.js to create a simple backend.  We’ll start by making sure the app can be displayed offline with cached resources, and learn how to persist data while the app is in offline mode.  We’ll also interact with native features like the camera, and learn how to let users install the app on their phone home screen.  Then we’ll customize the appearance of the app, including the app icon, splash screen, and phone status bar.

Finally, we’ll deploy the production app to heroku.  By the end of this course, you will have everything you need to create a Progressive Web App with React.
