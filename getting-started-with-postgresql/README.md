## Description
It’s amazing how much you can accomplish with a basic knowledge of SQL. In this course we’ll learn how to store lots of information (many millions of things!) and answer nearly any question we might have about that information (on the order of milliseconds!)

We’ll learn enough to make you say you “know SQL” -- table creation, inserts, selects, updates, deletes, aggregations, indexes, joins, and constraints. Along the way we’ll model real world problems so that you can see just how powerful SQL will make you!

If you’re interested in the Postgres client that is used in this course you can download it here to check it out and follow along.
