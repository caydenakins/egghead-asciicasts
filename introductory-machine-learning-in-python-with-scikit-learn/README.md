Asciicasts for [Hannah Davis](https://egghead.io/instructors/hannah-davis) course, Build Redux Style Applications with Angular, RxJS, and ngrx/store [egghead.io](https://egghead.io/courses/introductory-machine-learning-in-python-with-scikit-learn).

## Description

In this course we’ll learn about common machine learning algorithms, particularly those that don’t require implementing a neural network. We’ll implement these in Python using scikit-learn using scikit-learn’s inbuilt data sets.

About this course:

The focus of this course is on implementation and a high-level understanding of these algorithms. We will not be going too much into the math behind them, but instead learn what each algorithm is good for, and how to train them. We'll also learn about a few metrics for evaluating models.

Evaluating models:

In this course, we'll look at a few ways to evaluate our models, for both classification and regression models. We'll touch on mean squared error and coefficient of determination (for regression), and accuracy score, logarithmic loss, confusion matrices, and classification reports (for classification). More in-depth ways to evaluate models can be found at http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_evaluation.html.

Disclaimer:

We are working with toy datasets here, so it is important not to read too much into the numbers and accuracy results from these lessons. Real datasets will be much larger.

For additional information on installation, vocabulary, and common errors visit the README.md to the course code attached to each lesson.
