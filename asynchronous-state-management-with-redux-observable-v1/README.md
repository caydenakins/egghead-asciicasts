Asciicasts for [Shane Osbourne](https://egghead.io/instructors/shane-osbourne)'s course, Asynchronous State Management with redux-observable v1 on [egghead.io](https://egghead.io//courses/asynchronous-state-management-with-redux-observable-v1)

## Description
In this course, we will begin with nothing more than an empty directory & a text editor. Through small, focused lessons we’ll learn how to set up a React project that uses Redux for state management and redux-observable for asynchronous actions. We’ll see how ‘epics’ are registered and how they each receive a ‘stream’ of actions from the store.

With an understanding of how things work, we’ll move onto solving common problems such as Ajax cancellation, creating sequences of async actions, enabling code reuse through higher-order Observables and much more.
