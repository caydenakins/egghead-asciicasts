Instructor: [00:00] In this course, we're going to build UI features optimized for small viewports. More and more of our users depend on their mobile device to use our web apps.

[00:10] With this in mind, we're going to look at how to optimize the components we build for smaller viewports, and how to ensure our customer gets an optimized version of our web app for their device.

[00:20] Throughout the course, we'll discover how to test our implementations effectively on native device simulators, which, when compared with developing on a desktop browser, can give us the confidence that what we are seeing is what the user is seeing on their device.

[00:35] We're going to discuss CSS features that make a big difference, as often, some small stylistic changes can play a key role in how our page works on small viewports.

[00:47] Whether you're looking to refactor components built for larger screens or start from scratch, you'll find some key features to be incorporated on your web app, and find new approaches to web development for phones and tablets.
