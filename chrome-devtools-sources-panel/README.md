Asciicasts for [Mykola Bilokonsky's](https://github.com/mbilokonsky) course on [egghead.io](https://egghead.io/courses/chrome-devtools-sources-panel).

There are 5 transcripts, one transcript for each video.

## Description
This course examines the Sources panel in the Chrome DevTools, which allows you to see what files are responsible for the various things on the screen. Bundled into this panel, though, is the single most useful tool for any JavaScript developer - the JavaScript Debugger. We’ll use the Debugger to inspect JavaScript as it runs, allowing you to watch (and even interact with) the state of your application as it runs in ways that’ll blow your mind if you’ve mostly used console.log to debug your applications to this point.
