Asciicasts for [Josh Black's](https://github.com/joshblack) course on [egghead.io](https://egghead.io/courses/build-a-graphql-server).

There are 15 transcripts, one transcript for each video.

## Description
In this course we take a look at a new data query language and runtime called GraphQL. GraphQL was designed and built at Facebook to help product developers request and receive the data they need for their mobile and web applications. GraphQL sits on top of your application’s data access layer, providing clients with the ability to explicitly specify their data requirements, and the guarantee that this data won’t change.

GraphQL manages these kind of guarantees through a mixture of it’s Type System and Query semantics, both of which are pieces of GraphQL that we’ll look at in this series. We’ll also take a look at Mutations, and how to make our GraphQL Servers Relay-compliant using Nodes, Edges, and Connections.
