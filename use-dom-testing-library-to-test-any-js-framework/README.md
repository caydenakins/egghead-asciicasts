## Description
The person using your application components shouldn’t have to know or care what framework(s) you used to write your application. Guess what: Neither should your tests.

You’ll get hands-on experience writing tests for any JavaScript framework, giving you the confidence you need to ship your JavaScript application with your framework of choice.
