Asciicasts for [Rory Smith](https://egghead.io/instructors/rory-smith) course on [egghead.io](https://egghead.io/courses/manage-react-form-state-with-redux-form).

There are 14 transcripts, one transcript for each video.

## Description
In this course, we are going to use the redux-form package to create a form whose state is easy and enjoyable to manage.

Using redux-form, we have a resource which provides not only the benefit of integrating form state with an existing Redux application but also being able to track the state of our form with precision in Redux Dev Tools without writing lots of boilerplate code.

Specifically, we are going to find out how redux-form ties into a React/Redux application, how to use validation both synchronous and asynchronous, applying real-world examples, effective ways of presenting relevant information to the user and creating precise and reusable form components.

Working with forms can be laborious, but redux-form takes out the tedium and replaces it with an enjoyable experience creating beautifully crafted forms.
