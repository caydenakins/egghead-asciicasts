## Description
RxJS is tremendously helpful in working with asynchronous code, but youâ€™ve probably been stuck trying to use concepts you already know from Promises or Callbacks and applying them directly to RxJS. These lessons walk you through the step-by-step of building a simple game application with many asynchronous pieces. Each lesson focuses on a single operator or idea of how RxJS helps simplify your code as well as making you code flexible enough to easily add more asynchronous pieces as your codebase grows.
