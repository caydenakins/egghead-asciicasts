Instructor: [00:00] To install Rust we head over to rust-lang.org and then we click Install. We scroll down to this curl command here. Copy it and run it in our terminal. This will ask us to customize the installation, but we'll just proceed with the default one and hit 1.

[00:24] Once that is done, we have a few new commands, including rustc, the compiler program. We have cargo, the package manager, and we have rustup, the toolchain command.
