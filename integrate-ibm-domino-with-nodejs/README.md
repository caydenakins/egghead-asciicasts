There are 13 transcripts, one transcript for each video.

## Description
This course is for IBM Domino Developers who are looking to utilize NodeJS alongside their applications, or Javascript developers looking to integrate with a Domino server. The focus is on combining the strengths of Domino with the advantages of NodeJS, and it's about giving you options going forward.

We cover how you can continue to use Domino for user authentication and authorization while accessing a NodeJS / Express based application, including modifying the standard login form to expose authentication errors.

We show how to store user level information inside a JWT giving the option to store functional levels of access safely. This stateless token can then be decoded server side to list what user roles a user has and therefore can restrict functionality without having to refer back to Domino each time.

The course will demonstrate Create, Read, Update and Delete methods using the Domino Data Services all via the NodeJS application but still maintaining Domino security.

And finally, we show how you can reuse Domino generated HTML inside a handlebars template by scraping and manipulating the HTML.

You will need access to Domino server which is capable of running Domino Data Services and a recent installation of NodeJS. We will then cover using NodeJS / Express to get Domino Data and then show how to manipulate it server side using middleware before returning it to the browser.

Finally, we will show how to reuse HTML which has been generated by Domino; this will be done by using Cheerio to scrape the Domino pages and then manipulating/saving them as handlebars templates.
