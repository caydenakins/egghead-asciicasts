## Description
RxJS pushes values from Observables which get handed off to Subscribers to take care of the output. Operators handle all of the "in-between" operations where you can manipulate the values while they're still in-flight. This course dives into the internals of Operators and Subscribers and how to customize operators to your specific needs.

## Library Version
