Instructor: 00:01 In this course, we're going to be talking about a little utility called npx. If you use Node, then chances are high that you also use the npm package manager that comes with Node. You probably use it to install packages, update packages, run npm scripts, and lots more.

00:17 However, there's a little tool that comes baked into npm, if you have version 5.2 or above, called npx, that you may or may not know about. It's a handy little utility that enables you to play around with Node packages in a way that wasn't really easy before.

00:33 Have you ever wanted to run a locally installed Node module, but you really didn't want to jump through hoops to do so? How about playing around with a package from the npm registry, but you really don't want to install it globally just yet?

00:47 Npx is the tool for these things. You could even play around with an experimental GitHub branch with npx and so much more. I find myself using npx all the time.

00:58 It's one of those tools where you think at first, "Oh, that's simple." The more that you know about it, it could do so much more than you thought at first. Sit back and enjoy learning about npx.
