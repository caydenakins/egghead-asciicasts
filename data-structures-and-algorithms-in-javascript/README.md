Asciicasts for [Kyle Shevlin](https://egghead.io/instructors/kyle-shevlin)'s course, Data Structures and Algorithms in JavaScript on [egghead.io](https://egghead.io//courses/data-structures-and-algorithms-in-javascript)

## Description
This course teaches you how to implement your first data structures and algorithms. In the process, you’ll learn some fundamental computer science concepts as well. We’ll build these from scratch using JavaScript, but what we learn can be taken and used in any other language, too.

You will learn how to build: queues, stacks, linked lists, graphs, and trees. You’ll learn to implement several different sorting algorithms: bubble, insert, merge, and quick. Each of these lessons will not only teach you their implementation, but the tradeoffs made in choosing one over another. By proxy, you’ll learn about concepts like Big O notation and recursion.
