End-to-end testing gets a bad name. It's flaky. It's unreliable. It's slow. All of that changed with Cypress.

`Cypress` sees the world like a real user. It knows what's visible, what's hidden. It automatically waits for objects to show up on the DOM. No more sleeps. No more waits. Cypress handles this out-of-the-box.

You can travel through time. You can take screenshots. That all just undersell the sales pitch. That says Cypress is better and faster than what came before, but Cypress is more than that. It's a paradigm shift in end-to-end testing. That's because it can test every layer of the stack, the database, the API, the XHR request, our UI, our frontend stores, everything.

With `Cypress`, you can interact with your frontend and your backend and everything in between. Confusing error codes can become a thing of the past because if you test every layer in order, you can pinpoint the exact location where the contract breaks down. You can communicate with new team members more effectively what the dataflow looks like.

Yes, we can still use diagrams and drawings, but you can also say it all with the test now. Now you can't quite do all of this out-of-the-box with Cypress. That's why, in this course, I'm going to show you how you can build a transformative testing environment.
