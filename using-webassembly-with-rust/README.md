Asciicasts for [Nik Graf's](https://egghead.io/instructors/nik-graf) course on [egghead.io](https://egghead.io/courses/using-webassembly-with-rust).

There are 11 transcripts, one transcript for each video.

## Description
In this course we explore WebAssembly. While many languages work on a compilation story to WebAssembly Rust is already ready for prime-time. Rust is a stable language and great replacement for C and C++. Due to the reference and borrowing concept, it doesnâ€™t need a Garbage Collector and can be used for a production-ready WebAssembly project. In addition, the Rust/Wasm team has built some sophisticated tooling for straightforward interoperability between Rust and JavaScript.

In this course, we are going to set up a project and explore various paths of communication and interoperability between Rust and JavaScript.
