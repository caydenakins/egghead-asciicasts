Instructor: 00:00 One of the biggest complaints people tend to have about Redux is the amount of boilerplate code you end up writing to use it. It doesn't have to be that way.

00:08 In this course, we'll start with a fully functioning react and Redux application. This application is wired up with constants for our actions, action creators, reducer using a switch statement like you would expect, and redux func middleware for handling async actions.

00:21 We've cut down on the cognitive overload a bit by colocating action constants creators and the reducer code but worry factor this even further. We'll install the Redux actions library as a dependency, and look at it small, but powerful API. Redux actions will simplify the code for our action creators, and even give us a new way to create our reducers.

00:42 By using Redux actions or application we use Flux standard actions. Keeping the way, we manage our state more consistent. With that consistency, we'll open up capabilities to enhance on reducer to handle errors within the context of specific actions.

00:56 We'll also cover how to attach metadata to our actions without adding clutter to our payloads. This small library only exposes a few functions for its API, so it won't take long to learn, but it will make a huge difference in how we write action creators and reducers for Redux.
