## Description
Building an application with React typically involves the use of several tools. Whether you configure these on your own or use a tool meant to save you from the configuration like Create React App, the tools are still there. When you come up against a situation where you need to start from scratch or make changes to a webpack or babel configuration, it helps to understand what each tool does, how they fit together and how they are configured. In this course, we’ll start from an empty directory and by the end, we will have configured a slim, but powerful boilerplate project and along the way, we’ll touch on each of the major tools and build up to the final setup to gain an understanding of each tool’s purpose and how they all work together to help you build and deliver an application.
