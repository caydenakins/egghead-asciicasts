Kyle Shevlin: [0:01] Hey, everyone. Kyle Shevlin here with an introduction to my course on state machines and the XState library. I wanted to provide you with a brief overview of what we'll cover in the course. This course is roughly divided into three parts.

[0:14] In the first part, we'll explore the problems that state machines set out to solve. We'll take a function. We'll iterate on it until we get to a place where we understand where state machines come in and save the day.

[0:26] The second part is an introduction to the XState library and all its fundamental concepts, like machines, interpreters, states, events, actions, context, and guards. By this point, you should have a solid foundation for using the XState library on your own.

[0:42] In the final part, we explore more advanced state machines, such as hierarchical, parallel, and history states, as well as invoking services, like promises, callbacks, and even other machines.

[0:54] This is by no means an exhaustive introduction to the topic of state machines. My hope is that this introduction demonstrates their utility and encourages you to start using them in your work today. Finally, thanks for watching and enjoy the course.
