To create an AWS AppSync API, we can run the command `amplify add api`. For the type of service, choose `GraphQL`. Next, we're prompted to give the API a name. I'll give mine a name of `AmplifyTodoApp`.

#### Terminal 
```console
amplify add api
AmplifyTodoApp
```

For the authorization type, we'll choose `API key`. When we're asked if we have an annotated GraphQL schema, we'll choose `No`. If we'd like to have a guided schema creation, we'll choose `Yes`.

For what best describes our project, we're going to choose a `Single object with fields`. Next, we're given an option to go ahead and edit the schema. Choose `Yes`.

We're given an example todo GraphQL schema. We'll take the existing schema and add a new property of `completed` and then save the file.

#### schema.graphql 
```graphql   
type Toto @model {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  description: String
  completed: Boolean
}
```

Once the file's been saved, jump back to the command line and press `Enter`. Now the resources have been saved locally and we can run `amplify push` to create the resource in our account.

#### Terminal
```
amplify push
```

Once `amplify push` has successfully completed, open the AWS console. From the AWS console, search for "AWS AppSync" so we can go ahead and take a look at the new API that we just created.

In the API dashboard, you can click on Schema to take a look at the schema that's been auto-generated for us.

Next, click on Queries so we can begin executing queries and mutations against the API. The first thing we'd like to do is create a new todo. We'll create a `mutation` called `create`. To view the API documentation, you can click on the Docs link on the right side of the screen.

![Queries - Create Mutation](https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/v1549391501/transcript-images/react-native-create-interact-with-an-aws-appsync-graphql-api-with-aws-amplify-queries-and-create-mutation.jpg)

When we click on Mutations, we see that we have three different types of mutations, `createTodo`, `updateTodo`, and `deleteTodo`.

`createTodo` takes an `input` with a `name`, `description` and `completed` properties.

To execute the `mutation`, we can click on the orange Play button.

Now that we've created a couple of items, let's perform a query. We'll perform the `listTodos` query that returns an `items` array. We'll then return the `ID`, the `name`, the `description`, and the `completed` values for each todo in the array.

Now that we've populated our API with a little bit of data, let's query for the data from our React app. Back in our `App.js`, the first thing we'll do is we'll `import API` and `graphqlOperation from 'AWS-Amplify'`. Next, we'll define our `listTodos` query to return the `ID`, the `name`, the `description`, and the `completed` properties for every `item` in the todos array.

#### App.js
```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import logo from './logo.svg';
import './App.css';

import { withAuthenticator } from 'aws-amplify-react'
import { API, graphqlOperation } from 'aws-amplify'

const ListTodos = ` 
  query { 
    listTodos {
      items { 
        id name description completed 
      }
    }
  }
`
```

In the `class`, we'll create some initial `state` to hold the `todos` array and set it as an `empty` array. We'll create a `componentDidMount` life cycle method where we'll call `API.graphql`, passing in the `listTodos graphqlOperation`.

```javascript
class App extends Component {
  state = { todos: [] }
  async componentDidMount () {
    const todoDate = await API.graphql(graphqlOperation(ListTodos))
  }
  render() {
    return (
```

Once the data's returned from our API, we'll call `this.setState`, updating the `todos` array with the `data` returned from the API. In the `render` method, we'll `map` over the todos array, showing the `todo.name` and the `todo.description`.

```javascript
class App extends Component {
  state = { todos: [] }
  async componentDidMount () {
    const todoDate = await API.graphql(graphqlOperation(ListTodos))
    this.setState({ todos: todoData.data.listTodos.items })
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <header className="App-header">
          <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
          <h1 className="App-title">Welcome to React</h1>
        </header>
        {
          this.state.todos.map((todo, i)) => (
            <div>
              <h3>{todo.name}</h3>
              <p>{todo.description}</p>
            </div>
          ))
        }
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

Now we're ready to run the app. I'll go ahead and open the terminal and run `npm start`. 

#### Terminal 
``` 
npm start
```

If everything is working correctly, we should see the todos on our screen.
