Hey, everyone. My name is Kyle Shevlin. Welcome to my introductory course on functional programming in JavaScript, where we'll learn just enough of the concepts in order to start doing functional programming today.

One of the goals of this course is to introduce as little jargon as necessary. Functional programming vernacular can be very intimidating and, frankly, a barrier to entry. Let's break down those barriers. We'll avoid it whenever possible.

Another goal of this course is to teach you functional programming in a language-agnostic way. Sure, the course is written in JavaScript, but you can take these concepts and apply them equally as well to Haskell, Scala, Clojure, ReasonML, really any functional programming language.

Together, we're going to learn about higher-order functions, pure and impure functions, immutable data structures, currying, partial application, the importance of argument order in our functions, point-free programming, composition, a tiny little bit of math theory with the associative property, and how to debug our compositions.

My personal hope is to inspire you to take what you learn here and go explore functional programming even more. Thanks.
