Instead, it provides an approachable introduction to the paradigm that will give you the education and confidence you need to start using the programming style right away.

“Just Enough” focuses on the foundational knowledge needed to approach any functional language. By the end of the course, the student will understand the following: higher order functions, pure functions, immutability, currying, partial application, pointfree programming, functional composition and more.
