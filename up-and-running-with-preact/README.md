Asciicasts for [Shane Osbourne](https://egghead.io/instructors/shane-osbourne) course, Up and running with Preact on [egghead.io](https://egghead.io/courses/up-and-running-with-preact).

## Description

In this course we will begin with nothing more than an empty directory & a text editor. Through small, focussed lessons we’ll learn how to setup our app with Webpack & Babel and how to configure these tools for use with Preact. Then we’ll move on to learning how to create components and how the Preact API mirrors that of React - highlighting the differences/additions along the way. Finally we’ll look at the interoperability with existing popular libraries in the React community such as Redux & React Router and with the popular development tools such as Redux Dev Tools & React Dev-Tools

## Library Version
