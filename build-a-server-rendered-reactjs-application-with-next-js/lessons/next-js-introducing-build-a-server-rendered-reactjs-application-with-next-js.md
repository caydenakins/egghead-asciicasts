Instructor: [00:01] Welcome to my course on building a server-rendered React.js application with Next.js.

[00:07] For those unaware of Next.js, it's a framework that was created by ZEIT with the intention of providing a minimalist framework that React.js developers could rely on when building server-rendered JavaScript applications.

[00:21] Since first being released in October, 2016, the framework has generated a ton of buzz throughout the React community, and for good reason. Unlike many frameworks, Next.js puts the choice of using the tools that it provides completely in the hands of the developers. It makes incredibly easy-to-write custom servers, customized webpack, and much more. Many of these, we'll be checking out.

[00:53] In addition to making the development process a breeze, Next.js also takes into account the best practices in application optimization, by providing support right out of the box for things like code splitting, and route pre-fetching. The best part is, we won't have to write a single line of code to access this.

[01:17] To keep things interesting, we're building a blogging application that uses the Material UI framework to display posts that have been queried from Google's Blogger API. Once our blog is configured, we'll deploy it to a live URL using the now-cli command-line tool.

[01:36] Now that you know a little bit about Next.js, let's dive in.
