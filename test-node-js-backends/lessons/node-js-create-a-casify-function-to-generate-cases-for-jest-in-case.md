Instructor: [00:01] The last extra credit for this one is to improve the titles for `jest-in-case`. Our naÃ¯ve implementation of `jest-in-case` is pretty good, but the names are still not totally perfect. If we take a look at this, let's go ahead and break one of these right here. We're going to see that `no uppercase letters` is failing.

![No Uppercase](https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/v1575568618/transcript-images/05_scikit-learn-create-a-casify-function-to-generate-cases-for-jest-in-case-no-uppercase.jpg)

[00:18] We don't actually see anything in the output here to see what that input password was. It would be nice to know what that was. We're going to go ahead and add that to our test title by just taking this and adding that right here.

#### auth.exercise.js

```javascript
cases(
  "isPasswordAllowed: invalid passwords",
  ({ password }) => {
    expect(isPasswordAllowed(password)).toBe(false);
  },
  {
    "too short": {
      password: "a2c!"
    },
    "no letters": {
      password: "123456!"
    },
    "no numbers": {
      password: "ABCdef!"
    },
    "abc123! - no uppercase letters": {
      password: "abc123!"
    },
    "no lowercase letters": {
      password: "ABC123!"
    },
    "no non-alphanumeric characters": {
      password: "ABCdef123"
    }
  }
);
```

That's our `password`. There's the `password`, and this is why it should `return` `false`.

![Password in title](https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/v1575568745/transcript-images/05_scikit-learn-create-a-casify-function-to-generate-cases-for-jest-in-cas-password-in-title.jpg)

[00:38] It makes our title a lot better. I don't want to have to do all this duplication. Sometimes, you're going to find situations where it would be nice if the test title contained some of the inputs that you're going to be giving to your peer function.

[00:50] That's what we're going to do here. We're going to make this happen automatically with our own little abstraction around these cases. What I'm going to do is I'm going to make a `function`. I'm just going to call it `casify`. You could call it whatever you want.

```javascript
function casify(obj) {}
```

[01:03] Here, we're going to return `Object.entries` for that object.

```javascript
function casify(obj) {
  return Object.entries(obj);
}
```

We're going to pass this object to this Casify function. We're going to `map` that to an array. `jest-in-case`, it also accepts an array here, so what we're going to return is an array that has objects with a `name` property and `password` property.

[01:22] Here, we're going to say a function that's going to return our new object. We'll destructure the `name` and the `password`.

```javascript
function casify(obj) {
  return Object.entries(obj).map(([name, password]) => ({}));
}
```

That name is here and the password is here. I actually want to even simplify this further by just making it the `name` and then the `password`.

```javascript
cases(
  "isPasswordAllowed: valid passwords",
  ({ password }) => {
    expect(isPasswordAllowed(password)).toBe(true);
  },
  { "valid password": "!aBc123" }
);
```

[01:40] Because we're making this little abstraction ourselves, we can make the API for our cases as perfectly fit for our specific use case as possible. We're going to take that `name` and that `password`. We're going to return an object that has a `name` and a `password`.

[01:54] Except, remember the `name` is not what we want. We want to have the `name` be the `password`, as well as whatever the `name` is currently. We're going to set the `name` to `password-name`.

```javascript
function casify(obj) {
  return Object.entries(obj).map(([name, password]) => ({
    name: `${password} - ${name}`,
    password
  }));
}
```

We're going to call `casify` with this object.

```javascript
cases(
  "isPasswordAllowed: valid passwords",
  ({ password }) => {
    expect(isPasswordAllowed(password)).toBe(true);
  },
  casify({ "valid password": "!aBc123" })
);
```

If we save that, we'll see our title in there appropriately.

![Case title](https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/v1575568994/transcript-images/05_scikit-learn-create-a-casify-function-to-generate-cases-for-jest-in-case-title.jpg)

Let's go ahead and do that same thing for these cases. `casify`. We'll wrap this whole thing with `casify`.

[02:20] We have this new API that we've created for ourselves. I'm just going to do some multiple cursor magic here, get rid of all those objects. We'll just have the values.

```javascript
cases(
  "isPasswordAllowed: invalid passwords",
  ({ password }) => {
    expect(isPasswordAllowed(password)).toBe(false);
  },
  casify({
    "too short": "a2c!",
    "no letters": "123456!",
    "no numbers": "ABCdef!",
    "no uppercase letters": "abc123!",
    "no lowercase letters": "ABC123!",
    "no non-alphanumeric characters": "ABCdef123"
  })
);
```

Now our abstraction is actually really nice because it's super easy for people to add new `cases` for this particular function that we're testing.

[02:36] Now if we open up our test, we're going to see `abc123! - no uppercase letters`, and it's failing.

![No Uppercase Letters title](https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/v1575568739/transcript-images/05_scikit-learn-create-a-casify-function-to-generate-cases-for-jest-in-case-no-uppercase-title.jpg)

We can look at that and say, "Oh, the isPasswordAllowed used to say that this password had no uppercase letters, and it no longer does. Let me go figure out why that is."

[02:52] You can go back and uncomment the code that somebody commented out for some reason, and magic ensues. Your tests are all passing now.

[03:00] In review, what we did here was a little bit of JavaScript magic. We basically said, "Hey, we want to have a nicer API for our cases function call. For each one of these cases, I just want to have the reason that it's a valid password, and then what that password test should be.

[03:16] Then I'm going to pass that object to `casify`, and `casify` is going to take my own object and turn it into something that `jest-in-case` can use for its purposes.

[03:26] That function here -- it's going to be different here for every single time you do this. It depends on the particular function and abstraction that you're working with, but for us, we just take that object, we take all the entries in it.

[03:38] That's going to give us an array of arrays. We're going to map those arrays to pluck off the `name` and the `password`, and then here we'll return an object that has a `name`, which `jest-in-case` is going to use for the test title, and the `password`, which we're going to get in our options here.

[03:54] The `name`, we're going to say, is the password-the name. We're giving some of the inputs to our pure function and making that part of the test title, so that when `jest-in-case` runs our test, we can see that `password` in the test title, making it a lot easier to debug problems when they come up.
