Asciicasts for [Tomasz Łakomy](https://egghead.io/instructors/tomasz-lakomy)'s course, VR Applications using React 360 on [egghead.io](https://egghead.io//courses/vr-applications-using-react-360)

## Description
In this course, we will learn how to develop VR experiences in the web browser using React 360, a new, revamped version of library previously known as React VR. 

Each lesson will focus on a specific feature or component provided by React 360. Along the way we will implement a `TravelVR` app, which will allow the user to travel to different places around the world in an VR environment. 

Things we will learn include: 
- rendering React components on top of a 360 surface
- defining our own surfaces
- adding external 3D models to our app 
- and of course - building the app for production!

At the end of the course, you will be able to develop your own VR apps without having to learn technologies like WebGL or three.js. Instead, you can reuse your existing skills in React (or lack thereof, React 360 is easy to pick up even if you’re not really experienced in React) to develop VR applications in the browser.
