![course image](https://d2eip9sf3oo6c2.cloudfront.net/series/square_covers/000/000/145/full/EGH_FuncPurescript_Final.png)

Asciicasts for [Vincent Orr](https://egghead.io/instructors/vincent-orr) course on [egghead.io](https://egghead.io/courses/functional-programming-concepts-in-purescript).

There are 14 transcripts, one transcript for each video.

## Description
PureScript is a small strongly, statically typed language inspired by Haskell and compiles to JavaScript. This means no run-time errors, human readable output, ADTs, and pattern matching (and more!) all at your fingertips.

In this course we will use an online editor to show basics into PureScript with an instant visual representation, investigate the type system and ways to reason about common programing problems with PureScript.

As we explore the type system and common problems that are faced when programming in PureScript we will learn plenty of functional programming concepts as PureScript is a purely functional language.

## Library Version
[Purescript](https://github.com/purescript/purescript/releases): 0.11.7
