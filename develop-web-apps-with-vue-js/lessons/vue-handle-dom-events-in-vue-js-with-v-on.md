Here we have a button. Let's add v-on:click, and set that ="total += 1." Now, when we click the Add Dinosaur button, our total is incremented by one. We'll add an input field of type="number" and set v-model to the "amount" attribute on our component.
Let's change our click event on the button to "addDinos". Now, we can type a number into the input field, and click the button to add that amount to our total. Let's change our button text to reflect the amount of Dinosaurs being added. We want to make it so that the user can just press enter from the input field, to add that amount of Dinosaurs.
Let's add v-on:keyup.enter, and set it equal to "addDinos." Let's make this more accessible by wrapping these elements in a form element. On our form, let's add v-on:submit="add Dinos."
We can remove the events from the button and the input field, since the form will be taking care of those. In order to prevent the default action of the form, we can use the event modifier prevent.
