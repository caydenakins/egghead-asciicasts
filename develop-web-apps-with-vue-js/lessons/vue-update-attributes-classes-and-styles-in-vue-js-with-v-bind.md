Here, we've got a list of inputs that are bound using V-model to our components data block. Let's create a dynamic class by using v-bind class, then create a ternary based on the result of size toggle. If true, return the string, "large," and if it's false, return an empty string.
Let's add another class. We do that by turning v-bind class into an array. For the second [inaudible 0:25] in the array, let's create a key value pair. Vue will render this key if the value returns true. We can use v-bind disabled to bind the disable state of our button to a variable disabled.
What if we wanted to bind to an entire block of inline styles? Let's add v-bind style and set that equal to styles. Styles will need to be a computed property in this case, so we'll create a computed block after data and add a styles method.
That method will return a block of key value pairs. These keys and values will be displayed as inline styles in the Vue, so we need to use actual CSS properties. Now, we have a large rounded but disabled button with an orange background and white text that we can slide over to the left.
